9c6cc6f9b1c273e8c58cd6c0ca574d2aa9bf007b,"As Australian Fashion Week comes to a close, a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in Australia and their companies, for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay.","Australian Fashion Report revealed the Australian-sold brands and companies that ignore the exploitation of their overseas workers .

d604fabaf467a3c3e29e2314304c9cadedb31514,"Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed. Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'. 'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making ""stereotypical assumptions"" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added. Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said. Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability, after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, pictured, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat . Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned. More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long-term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them, the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed.","Survey of 1,000 firms showed half are less inclined to recruit obese people .

35d559779b0b9849bd394864a13c14eaa845f877,"A robot has been 'arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, along with the other items it bought. They described the police's actions as an 'unjustified intervention into the freedom of art'. Writing on their blog, London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo, who were behind the project, said: 'Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. 'At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. 'In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. 'The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. 'We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot, for us and for freedom of art!' The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets, pictured above, were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography, drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However, the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself, they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Mr Smoljo and Miss Weisskopf said: 'The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there.'","Random Darknet Shopper is a computer bot that randomly purchases an item every week from a hidden part of the internet called the dark net .

Cell phone footage, recorded by the unnamed customer, starts with the woman repeatedly asking to speak to the manager to complain about the quality of a milkshake that she had just been served. After four separate requests to speak to a manager, the customer finally got the employee's attention. A complaint about an unsatisfactory milkshake served at a Louisiana branch of Burger King quickly turned ugly when the employee started cursing before getting physical with the customer . The customer then asked for a refund, but the exchange quickly descended into a heated argument and the member of staff starts to curse at the customer. 'Baby, you're about to get it,' the employee is heard saying. 'Just wait. You're gonna get your s***.' 'You're cursing,' the customer replied. 'Are you serious? Are you serious?' 'You cannot treat people like this, this is your job,' she continued. 'Are you for real?' 'No, I'm fake,' the employee snapped back. The footage, first posted on Live Leak, claims to have been taken on Tuesday at a branch in Lake Charles. 'I don't know what happened to you today. And I'm sorry, but you handed me soft serve ice cream and then gave me some garbage and I'm not going to eat it,' the customer explained. 'And you're rude.'

7752c685358c5badf6dd5f3798386e9ff64dac3c,"A South Australian law professor has said that police acted ‘outrageously’ by subjecting a woman to an oral swab test after she was reported for flashing her breasts. Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View and was reported by police with disorderly behaviour. She handed herself into police voluntarily. However, ABC News reports that South Australian law professor Rick Sarre believed it should not result in charges or a court appearance and that the swab was unnecessary. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . ‘I think it's outrageous, but I know young juvenile offenders who have been questioned over certain things who have had the same thing happen to them,’ he said. 'That behaviour's being defended by the police commissioner, who says ''that's what happens these days''. ‘That doesn't surprise me because unfortunately that's the kind of law and order climate in which this Government has pushed us in the last dozen years.’ The 38-year-old was captured streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. 'The woman’s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Ms Davis, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy caused by her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.","Karen Davis was photographed on Google Street View flashing her breasts .

9f81c3049ff1b636ba416283ba4f5326fd578cc8,"She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match. The 29-year-old from Chicago has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, ""Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,""' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS. A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.","Jennifer Pagonis has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)

2bf4a6d6bb55027200d87c35150a18a546482aef,"A farmer who has constructed a rather suggestive hay bale structure, which is fully exposed out the front of his property, could face pornographic charges. The sculpture, made out of bales of compressed grass, depicts the obscene intimacy between a cow and a bull. Bruce Cook, who owns Kaktus Point Charolais stud at Lake Charm in northwest Victoria, told Daily Mail Australia that police told him to pull down the model after they received a complaint about the offensive nature of the statue. Bruce Cook has been warned by police that he may face serious charges if he doesn't take down his 'offensive' hay bale structure out in front of his property at Lake Charm, northwest of Victoria . Mr Cook put up his 'realistic' artwork on Good Friday just for 'a bit of fun'.  He says many passersby have enjoyed his sculpture and even stopped to take photos . But he has refused to do so and further 'told the copper to p*ss off' despite police warning that Mr Cook could be charged with 'publishing pornographic images', the NT News reports. Mr Cook, also known as 'Cooky', described his artwork as 'a bit of fun' which he put up on Good Friday. He says many passersby have enjoyed his sculpture and even stopped to take photos. The 59-year-old owns the property out at Lake Charm and isn't too fazed by the complaints about his sculpture . 'It's just a realistic piece of artwork so I really don't know what the fuss is about,' the farmer said . 'On Saturday morning, I saw about 10 cars parked out the front because they stopped to take photos of the art,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The cop called me and told me they received a complaint about the sculpture because it was indecent. He told me that I could face serious charges if I don't take it down. 'But I told the copper to p*ss off. I'm not going to take it down unless I receive a court order.' Mr Cook says he will be adding fairy lights to the structure tonight and plans to add an extra two calves to complete the sculpture .

Although the 59-year-old isn't fazed by the complaints about his structure, he doesn't quite understand why anyone would find it insulting. 'It's just a realistic piece of artwork so I really don't know what the fuss is about,' he said. 'People offended by it must have a dirty mind or are just prudish.' The 59-year-old farmer said 'people offended by it must have a dirty mind or are just prudish' And just to add a bit of cheek, Mr Cook says he will be adding fairy lights to the structure tonight and plans to add an extra two calves to complete the sculpture.

5f3463b958faa33399600d976aa440e130b3a25a,"Transgender model Andreja Pejic has revealed that she was told by people within the fashion industry that she would no longer seem ‘special’ or ‘interesting’ once she completed her transition into a woman. The 23-year-old Serbian-born fashion star, who appears in a solo editorial in the May issue of Vogue, told the publication that she was advised not to undergo her gender reassignment surgery because it would transform her from an interesting enigma into just another pretty girl. Andreja noted that there were people who warned her not to transition, explaining: ‘There was definitely a lot of, ""Oh, you’re going to lose what’s special about you. You’re not going to be interesting anymore. There are loads of pretty girls out there.""' Scroll down for video . Fashion pioneer: Transgender model Andreja Pejic posed for photographer Patrick Demarchelier for a spread in Vogue. The 23-year-old revealed to the magazine that she is the new face of Make Up For Ever . Major debut: The model, who underwent gender-confirmation surgery last year, took to the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show in February (pictured) One agent even told her that 'it's better to be androgynous than a tranny', but Andreja refused to fall prey to those opinions. 'It is about showing that this is not just a gimmick,' she said of being transgender. Andreja also revealed during the interview that she has been signed as the newest face for beauty brand Make Up For Ever, and is thought to be the first ever transgender model to land a major cosmetics campaign. And her success is, she hopes, a sign that there is a cultural shift occurring within the industry when it comes to gender identity. 'There are just more categories now,' she told Vogue. 'It’s good. We’re finally figuring out that gender and sexuality are more complicated.' Andreja was born in what is now known as Bosnia-Herzegovina and later to emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. She grew up as a boy named Andrej, although she admitted that she was unsure where she fit in during her adolescence. She even considered being gay, but explains that even that 'didn't fit', saying: 'Society doesn’t tell you that you can be trans.' Andreja recalled wanting to 'stop puberty in its early tracks' because she was worried about her jawline becoming too strong and her feet and hands growing too large . Fashion friends: Andreja posted this picture of herself posing alongside Kendall Jenner while the pair were backstage at the Giles  show . Two worlds: Before her sex reassignment procedure, Andreja made a name for herself as both a male and female model, having modeled menswear (L) and womenswear (R) for Jean Paul Gaultier . But at 6'1, Andreja, who also wears a size 11 shoe, fits in perfectly with her fellow models. On her first modeling gig she looked around the room and told herself she didn't need to worry because 'every girl in fashion is exactly the same'. Before undergoing her sex reassignment surgery, Andreja made a name for herself within the fashion industry as both a male and a female model, with her androgynous look allowing her to showcase both male and female designs. She modeled Jean Paul Gaultier's Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2012 collection in Paris in July 2012, before going on to showcase the same designer's menswear range as part of Paris Fashion Week in January 2013. She took the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show show at London Fashion Week in February. And her new cosmetics campaign is just the latest means of her continuing to break boundaries – something which is already being echoed throughout the fashion industry by many other models. Last month, it was announced that transgender teen Jazz Jennings, 14, would be the new face of skincare brand Clean & Clear's new 'See The Real Me' campaign. And in November Brazilian transgender model and Givenchy muse Lea T landed a highly-coveted campaign with the American hair-care brand Redken.

a6a7df3e25e13dccd5df2e4f3cd7524bff686aed,"President Barack Obama announced today $200 million in additional U.S. humanitarian aid to Iraq, but declined to say whether Washington would provide Apache helicopters, drones and other arms to Baghdad to help with the ongoing fight against ISIS. 'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi. Mr. Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said the Iraqi leader did not make a specific request for additional military support during the meeting. President Barack Obama announced today $200 million in additional U.S. humanitarian aid to Iraq, but declined to say whether Washington would provide Apache helicopters, drones and other arms to Baghdad to help with the ongoing fight against ISIS . 'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, left . Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becoming prime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meant to convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has sought to be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq. The Obama administration, which welcomed Abadi's ascension after a tricky relationship with former Prime Minister Nurial-Maliki, may not agree to provide significant additional support. Obama, who was elected on the back of a promise to end the war in Iraq, is limited by public aversion to U.S. entanglement in another regional conflict and congressional constraints on his budget authority. In August, Obama authorized the first U.S. air strikes on Iraq since the 2011 withdrawal of American troops. He has also deployed about 3,000 American military forces to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. Abadi said after the meeting that Iraq would respect other countries' sovereignty and expected the same. He also said he was eager to bring all of the fighters in Iraq under state control. 'I am aware that regional countries have their own interests and I respect these interests, but I also welcome any assistance that they would provide, and I would like to thank them,' Abadi said through a translator. 'However, we do not accept any intervention in Iraq or any transgression on Iraqi sovereignty. This is a war that is fought with Iraqi blood with help from the coalition forces and regional countries.' The U.S. president in turn warned Iran that its fighters must respect Iraq's sovereignty and answer to the government in Baghdad in the battle against ISIS. Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becomingprime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meantto convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has soughtto be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq . Vice President Joe Biden, left,  and National Security Advisor Susan Rice also participated in the Oval Office discussion of the strategic partnership between the two countries, support in fighting ISIS as well as commercial and cultural relations . Iran-backed Shi'ite militias have played a major and growing role in battling the Sunni Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, that emerged from the chaos in Iraq and neighboring Syria and which swept through northern Iraq last June. Abadi has had to rely on Shi'ite militias, some of which are backed by Iran and advised by Iranian military officers, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the face of the Islamic State onslaught. Obama said he and Abadi discussed the issue at length in their Oval Office meeting on Tuesday. Asked about Iranian involvement in Iraq, Obama said that he expected the neighbors to have an 'important relationship,' and recognized that the mobilization of Shi'ite militias had been necessary to counter ISIL's advance last year. But he added that any foreign-backed groups in Iraq should now be under Abadi's control. 'Once Prime Minister Abadi took power ... from that point on, any foreign assistance that is helping to defeat ISIL has to go through the Iraqi government. That's how you respect Iraqi sovereignty,' Obama said. 'It needs to be help that is not simply coordinated with the Iraqi government, but ultimately is answerable to the Iraqi government and is funneled through the chain of command.'","Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit to the Oval Office .

Please no: A Kentucky Wildcats fan reacts in the stands after being defeated by the Wisconsin Badgers during the NCAA Men's Final Four Semifinal in Indianapolis . The Wildcats close the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trending on Twitter: '38-and-Done.' And '38-and-1.' All easy pickins for the many detractors of John Calipari's group of 'One and Done' players, All-Americans and other future first-round and lottery picks. There are other programs with talent, though. Wisconsin has some future pros, and they came up big in the biggest game of their lives - a rematch of last year's semifinals where the Wildcats won 74-73. The Wildcats had the reputation as the team that never quits when things don't look so good - a la last week's win over Notre Dame - but Wisconsin came up clutch this time.

Wisconsin Badgers forward Sam Dekker (left) and guard Traevon Jackson (right) jump in the air after the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Championship semi-final game against the Kentucky Wildcats at Lucas Oil Stadium . 'They did to us what we've been doing to other teams all season,' Calipari said. 'They executed down the stretch and we didn't.' Trailing by four and gasping for breath with their hands on their knees after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. It started with a tough, twisting shot by a future NBAer, Sam Dekker (16 points), and kept going when Nigel Hayes tipped in an air ball after the shot clock had clearly turned to '0.' No violation was called, and in a game full of shaky officiating that left both coaches screaming, it generated momentum for the Badgers and left Kentucky flat.

The White House said today that Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month held in honor of the Japanese Prime Minister, confirming rumors that Bernard, 53, would soon exit the administration. The first lady said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy,' she added. 'Jeremy will be missed, and Barack and I wish him the very best in all of his future endeavors.' The first lady, pictured here in November 2011 with White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard in Hawaii, said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' Obama added, 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy' The White House did not name a replacement for Bernard, who is also the first gay man to hold the position, nor did it explain why he was leaving. Michelle Obama spoke highly of his time on staff, however, saying, 'For the last four years, Jeremy has worked tirelessly to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible and to make each and every event in the White House one to remember, not only for Barack and me, but for the tens of thousands of guests who pass through our doors each year.' Bernard simply stated that it's been an 'honor' to serve the Obamas and lauded the first lady for welcoming 'every guest to the White House with her signature warmth, grace and style.' 'I feel so privileged to have worked for such an extraordinary President and First Lady,' his statement read. The former California resident told the Washington Post that he planned to return to The Golden States, and he's 'really looking for some time to think about what’s next and spend some quality time with Garbo, my rescue beagle.' Bernard is pictured here catching snowflakes on the Colonnade of the White House in this February 2014 photo captured by the building's official photographer. The White House today confirmed that Bernard, 53, would depart after a state dinner next month . According to a profile of Bernard in Vogue, Bernard stumbled into politics in the early '90s while waiting tables in Los Angeles. There he met a fundraiser for then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Dave Mixner, who brought him under his wing and into Clintonland. Bernard later formed a California-based political consulting firm with his ex-boyfriend, Democratic operative Rufus Gifford, that became the vehicle for Barack Obama's West Coast fundraising during his first campaign for president. Obama rewarded Bernard for his hard work with an appointment as the White House's liaison to the National Endowment for the Humanities. He briefly served as the chief of staff to the U.S. Ambassador to France in 2010 before accepting the position of social secretary the following year with his boss' blessing. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as social secretary since February 2011, carefully avoiding the limelight, unlike his predecessor Desirée Rogers, the first African-American social secretary, who was forced out of the administration after just 13 months on the job. It was during Rogers' tenure that socialites Michaele and Tareq Salahi crashed a White House state dinner in 2009. The couple went on to start in Bravo's Real Housewives of D.C. reality TV series. No such mishaps happened during the tenure of Bernard, whose behind-the-scenes work kept the White House in shipshape during social events. His first interview since taking the job, the Vogue profile, did not hit newsstands until February of this year - his fourth anniversary as social secretary. Asked for the interview why he believes he was chosen for the job, Bernard said, 'I would imagine part of it is a trust issue. I was there from the beginning. I was a known quantity. They certainly knew that I was loyal and supportive.' This March 18 photo shows, from left to right, Jeremy Bernard, Democratic operative Karen Finney, Executive Director of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities Rachel Goslins, and former Obama administration officals Stephanie Cutter at the ELLE and HUGO BOSS Women in Washington Power List Dinner at The Residence of the German Ambassador. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as White House social secretary since February 2011 and has carefully avoiding the limelight for the better part of his tenure . Under Bernard's watch, the White House has moved from formal printed invitations for many events to an email system. It has also shed the tradition of seating husbands and wives away from each other at dinners. Bernard told Vogue his team had received 'some criticism' for departing from the traditional seating chart, but it done in accordance with the first lady's will. 'it does bring a comfort level,' he said, of husbands and wives being allowed to sit together. 'And I believe that was part of what Mrs. Obama wanted. 'It is still the White House, still very historic and traditional, but it doesn’t have to be uncomfortable.' Speaking to the Washington Post about his impeding departure, Bernard summed up his work as making 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 'as open as possible and to grant access to as many people as possible, especially people who had never been to the house before.' 'It’s easy to fall into patterns, and what Mrs. Obama has been able to do is have an attitude that keeps it fresh,' he said. At the time of the Vogue interview, which was conducted over several months, dating back to the beginning of November even though it was not published until February, Bernard claimed not to know what his next professional move would be and said he was focusing on the last two years of the Obamas' residency in the White House. 'The good thing about this job—and perhaps the bad thing—is that I am not able to think about the future,' he said. Bernard said that a previous White House social secretary told him 'she lost sleep toward the end because people told her she would go on to do great things next, but they never told her what.' 'She warned me that I do have to start thinking about it,' he recalled. 'I know I do; I just haven’t yet. I’m sort of putting my head in the sand.'","White House said today that Jeremy Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month, confirming rumors he'd soon exit the administration .

Before and after images show how the wave of snow, ice and rock flattened the usually serene 18,000-foot-altitude base camp on Saturday. The avalanche started on Mount Kumori, a 23,000-foot-high mountain just a few miles from Everest, and gathered strength as it tore across the world's highest peak. Half an hour after the initial quake, another magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit, followed by smaller aftershocks across the region. Eighteen people died in the avalanche, including four Americans, and 61 were injured, according to Nepal's mountaineering department. Scroll down for videos . Covered: An image, left, shows Everest Base Camp as it usually looks in April compared to how the same place looked following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday.

Before the storm: The snow-covered scenes are in start contrast to how the base camp (seen in 2013) usually looks at this time of year . Flattened: But on Saturday, an avalanche pummeled the campers at the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp, leaving it covered with snow . American Google executive Dan Fredinburg, 33, was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain. New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed by the avalanche where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. On Sunday the first survivors were flown off Everest by aid helicopters and began sharing their incredible stories of survival. Bhim Bahudar Khatri, a cook for a climbing team, said: 'I was cooking for my team in the meal tent when the earthquake hit. We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me. 'I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive. 'I dug a few more feet until I was out of the snow and could breathe. I looked around and saw the tents all torn, crushed and many people injured. I had lived, but lost many of my friends.' An Everest guide, Pemba Sherpa, 43, added: 'I was resting in my tent when the earthquake hit. I heard a big noise and the next thing I know I was swept away by the snow. I must have been swept almost 200 meters. I lost consciousness. Wreckage: People look over the scene on Saturday after the earthquake triggered the avalanche that flattened parts of the base camp .

Fight for survival: One survivor recalled 'a huge wall of snow' falling on him and how he had to claw his way out to survival . Recovery: A group is seen carrying an injured climber in their sleeping bag; more than 60 people were injured in the incident . Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest . 'When I regained consciousness, I was in a tent surrounded by foreigners. I did not know what happened or where I was.' He said the toll on Everest was sure to rise: 'There are still many people who are still missing on the mountain. There were several tents buried by the snow, several blown away.' Michael Churton, a filmmaker from New York, was with four other colleagues at the base camp when the earthquake hit, and he said that it took about 45 seconds for the avalanche to finish. 'I told the group to get down,' he said. 'It was about 4,000 feet of snow just coming and there was nowhere to run.' After curling up into a fetal position, he was thrown into a rock, which left him with cuts to his face and a black eye - but he was otherwise uninjured. Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest. Speaking from his sleeping bag at base camp on the north side of the mountain, the experienced climber said his group took cover after rocks the size of cars came crashing down around them. 'At first we could feel the trembling under the tent, but it was eerie as there was no noise, it was silent. Then it felt like we were shaking on a huge plate of jelly,' he said. 'It was so strange feeling the ground turn to jelly under our feet and we thought the mountain would start crashing down on us.' The instructor from Adventure Peaks, who was leading a group of eight clients on their first trip up the mountain, said the area was badly hit by rock falls, but they all escaped injury. Killed: Three Americans died on the mountain: Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, (left), who was working as a medic at the time, Google exec Dan Fredinburg, 33, (center with his ex-girlfriend, actress Sophia Bush) and documentary filmmaker Tom Taplin, 61 (right) Heading out: Rescuers carry a sherpa injured by the avalanche. The quake is believed to have killed more than 4,000 people . Heading home: A rescue helicopter prepares to land on Sunday and the first survivors were carried off the mountainside . 'Sure enough, an area of steep cliffs did break off sending car sized boulders hurtling down only a few hundred metres from our tents. We are still feeling aftershocks hours later. 'We were very lucky as no one in our group has been injured, but one climber was struck by a boulder.' He said their main priority was now working out how to leave base camp and make their way home, as the road to Kathmandu has been obliterated by the quake. 'We are trapped and have nowhere to go, we can't get back to Kathmandu, the road has been completely destroyed and there is absolutely no way to get through.' Climber Garrett Madison, who runs Seattle-based firm Madison Mountaineering, described how he was leading his group up the mountain when he heard the terrifying sound of avalanches. 'We heard an awful noise and heard avalanches coming down either side of the valley,' he said. 'We thought we were going to get wiped out but we were only dusted by a snow cloud. We proceeded up to Camp Two and contacted Base Camp where we heard of the awful destruction.' On Monday, it emerged that the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 4,400 people, with more than 8,000 injured. The toll is expected to rise as assessments are made in vulnerable mountain villages that have been inaccessible since the quake. Nepalese officials have speculated that the number of casualties could reach as high as 10,000.","Photographs taken after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake sparked an avalanche on Mount Everest on Saturday show the campsite buried beneath snow and belongings strewn across the mountain .

ODB is no longer alive . Palmquist admitted to partying with the guys from the Wu, but denied that she did anything sexual with them . Palmquist told show host Judge Lynn Toler: 'This sounds ridiculous, but he accused me of sleeping with the entire Wu-Tang Clan.' Sellers quickly fired back: 'She did.' The accused woman went on to tell Judge Toler that she did hang with the Clan on their tour bus and stay at their hotel until 7am talking politics, but maintained she stayed faithful to Sellers. She said: 'Nothing inappropriate happened and let me just put on the record that Wu-Tang is nothing but gentleman. 'They treated me highly respectful. 'I would never cheat on him. 'I would never be a bust-down or a groupie in that type of situation.' Unfortunately her ex-boyfriend wasn't buying it and Sellers said: 'She gave Wu some tang.' It's unclear who Judge Lynn believed, but she did say Palmquist engaged in 'bust-down behavior'. Sellers wasn't buying anything that his ex-girlfriend had to say and told the judge: 'She gave Wu some tang' It's unclear who Judge Lynn believed in the matter, but she did say Palmquist engaged in 'bust-down behavior' In March, the Wu-Tang Clan opened the silver box that held their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin . Sellers and Palmquist went on Divorce Court after being together for five years, according to the show's description of the episode. It read: 'The two met at a Halloween party where Lia was dressed as Lil Kim and Nathan was dressed as Hello Kitty. 'Lia says things were good for the first few years they dated until Nathan moved six hours away to attend school. 'Lia says Nathan then moved to San Francisco for a few months chasing his dreams of being a fashion designer, before moving back in with her again. 'Lia says her sex life with Nathan is non-existent right now. 'She says she wants a traditional family with kids, and she doesn’t think Nathan does.' Earlier this year, the Wu-Tang Clan opened the silver box that held their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin and sold the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. Under the terms of the sale, the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for a playing of the album. It was the first and last time any of the album was played before the year 2103.","On Divorce Court episode Nathan Sellers went on show with Lia Palmquist and accused her of sleeping with every single member of Wu-Tang Clan .

d467b8bd70dc904ceaa43cd5804b29cf9cb205c6,"When Nic Newling recalls his childhood, he remembers misleading highs and deep depressions where the only option he could see for himself was committing suicide. But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 . It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective . Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles . 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself of his confusing emotions. 'On average, statistics show that it takes 20 years for someone with bipolar to go from having the symptoms to being diagnosed - and that's not even treating it,' Nic said. 'Compared to that, I'm one of the lucky ones.' A high achiever from a young age, Nic (pictured left and right) 'crashed' after pushing himself too hard in the first year of high school . His anxiety and depression progressed into a type of psychosis and he soon admitted himself into a psychiatric ward for almost nine months . But along with the cold, stale, square rooms, the psychiatric wards offered a surprising comfort: other people who were not afraid to talk about mental illness. 'I really liked that psych ward. I didn't want to leave because I met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world … and the reason I really got along with these guys was because it was the first time I had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue. 'They'd be like ""what have you got?"" and I'd say ""I think I have psychosis or depression"" and they'd just say ""OK, cool. Do you want to play Nintendo now?"" That planted the seed a little bit: maybe talking about this stuff is really helpful, not damaging.' The level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that Nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother Christopher. 'Everyone was really worried about me being suicidal because it was such a measured thought-out decision for me - I was sort of at the point where I was convinced there was no point in living but couldn't deal with the guilty because my family had been so good to me,' Nic said. 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic (pictured) was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun . 'Then Chris ended up killing himself when I had just turned 16 and he was just shy of 18. 'He had his heart set on being a professional rugby player but had some problems with his legs and had to get surgery. He was bed ridden for a while and that made his depression and anxiety a lot worse because he pretty much just lived for rugby. 'He became withdrawn: he wouldn't talk about his depression. I was open about it to close friends and family whereas he would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man. Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Nic's eldest brother was left to organize Christopher's funeral while his mother became a recluse and the rest of the family tried to shield Nic from the event, desperate to avoid another tragedy. Christopher's (left and right) mental health problems peaked after a surgery that left him bed ridden and unable to play rugby: 'He would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man' 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness. 'After he died there were five chairs at the dinner table and only four people and you can't ignore that. We started having dinner in front of the television permanently because, what do you talk about? How can you discuss anything and have that chair sitting there?' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun. His death shattered their family: 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness,' Nic said (pictured from a young age with his brothers and father) 'Our first family Christmas in a very long time, just last year': Left to right Ben and his son Zach, mum, dad, Nic's best friend Ryle, Nic, and family friend Daisy . 'I'd had heaps of different meds for heaps of different diagnosis. I'd had shock therapy when I was 16 which was once I'd had every meds that existed for the condition and meant we were really scraping the bottom of the barrel by falling back on like 1960s meds,' he said. 'But it wasn't that the meds weren't working or the dosage was wrong, it was that I was being treatment for something I didn't have.' 'Now things are good. I take a small maintenance dose of medication, one pill a day, with no side effect: a mood stabilizer which just feels like taking a vitamin. I've got a great job working in mental health, I live with my best friend, have a great girlfriend - I don't want to say it's perfect, but what a dramatic turnaround!' As an outspoken advocate for mental health and suicide prevention who advocates loudly about the importance of seeking help, Nic aims to raise awareness about the importance of GPs - the front-line of any mental health help and diagnosis - brushing up on mental illness research and data to improve diagnoses .

566bd1ce515078f08ad1bd91c2baec06c3ea4947,"The Long Island mother and daughter found safe and well in New York City's Upper West Side neighbourhood after going missing last month say they had no idea that people were looking for them. Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily, 14, were recognized by the front desk manager of the hotel they were staying at on Sunday, it was reported. They were found at 3am by NYPD officers and are in good health, officials said. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they disappeared. They have now been found safe and well . Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police questioned mother and daughter and now consider the case closed after releasing them. Iona called her mother at 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning to tell her she was ok. 'I'm thankful my daughter is safe. She's had a lot of pressure,' Iona's mother, Diana Malcolmson, told the New York Daily News. 'She just wanted to get away.' Iona claimed she had no idea friends and family members were worried about her sudden disappearance, her mother said. 'She hadn't listened to the news. She didn't know she was causing all this trouble,' Malcolmson said. Iona is in the midst of a nasty battle over the will of her husband, George Costello Sr., 63, who died of a heart attack as he was working on a Southampton barge on Dec. 28, 2012. News of Iona's reappearance comes after more details emerged about the colorful background of her late husband's family, who were in dispute with her over the contents of Mr Costello's will. It was revealed that the mother's stepson has a long criminal record and was jailed again just days after she disappeared, a report suggests. George Costello Jr is currently in jail in Florida on apparently unrelated charges and has been described by relatives as a 'mixed-up' kid.' British-born Mrs Costello and Emily were visiting Manhattan when they went missing on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan, but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona's husband died in 2012 from a heart attack, and she is believed to have been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. The New York Daily News reported Iona's stepson Costello Jr, 45, was visiting Hamptons Bay, New York, at the time, and relatives said he has never got on with the family. He has a long history of drug arrests and is currently in Palm Beach Detention Center following an arrest for a 'domestic dispute' when he returned to Florida. His fiance, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the Daily News  it was a 'weird coincidence', but insists she was with him the whole time. Speaking from the prison, he told the newspaper he was visiting his Hampton Bay home at the time and flew home on April 1, two days after the pair went missing. George Jr, who has at least 10 arrests to his name, according to court records, says he didn't have a close relationship with Iona. He said the last time the pair spoke was at his father and her husband's funeral. Police reportedly told Iona's mother there is surveillance video of them leaving a parking garage laughing . Iona's brother-in-law John Costello (right), is facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. Costello's stepson, George Costello Jr (left), 45,  has a long history of drug arrests (mugshot from April) 'She's a hardworking lady who loves her horses and takes care of them really well. She's a good mother,' he told the Daily News. Iona's mother, Diana Malcomson, had also insisted George Jr wouldn't want to harm the pair, but said he was a 'mixed-up kid'. Her brother-in-law is also facing a criminal case. John Costello is  facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. They were reported missing by relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork. Iona, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can't sell anything. She can't do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don't know if she's having a nervous breakdown. I don't know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm said earlier it was strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online  his force did not suspect foul play. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones had gone straight to voicemail. Mrs Costello's family have lived in both the UK and the US, but she is British by birth. Her mother Diana and late father Euan, a stockbroker, lived in Stow in the Wold, Gloucestershire before setting sail for North America in 1958 aboard the Liberte cruise ship. Their plan was to live in Canada but they instead moved to Long Island. The couple returned to the UK at some point and records indicate that Mrs Costello was born in Marylebone in Central London, as was her brother Andrew. Mrs Costello's aunt Gwendoline Preston married Lord William Wynne-Jones, a renowned chemist and former vice-chancellor of Newcastle University.","Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily went missing on March 30 .

Denies allegations: James Evans who runs Premiere Photo allegedly didn't apologize for the racial slur and told the couple to 'sue' him . Attorney Cathy Hale who is representing the couple said that the sister of the bride  waited to tell her about what happened until after the wedding because she didn't want to ruin her special day or upset her. 'She made the wise decision not to tell her and spoil that specific day,' Hale told Click2Houston. Hale says that when the husband heard about the photos at the wedding he was horrified and called James Evans of Premiere Photo. The groom claims Evans  didn't even apologize.

The 19-year-old defied doctors' expectations after she was diagnosed with a rare form of inoperable brain cancer just after her 18th birthday. She was told she would not live past December but died four months later this month after playing with her college team at Mount St Joseph University in Cincinnati to raise $1.5million for research into childhood cancer. Scroll down for video . The casket of  basketball player Lauren Hill was placed at the site where she made her first basket five months ago, before she died of an inoperable brain tumour this month. Her high school team mates gathered to remember her at a memorial today in the arena where she scored her first basket for her college team . Today mourners at the arena celebrated her life and determination in the face of the obstacles she overcame in her short life. Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma after she became dizzy following a basketball game with her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The tumour is found on the brain stem and can cause double vision and difficulty controlling facial expressions. Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor. After doctors found the tumour just after the teenager's 18th birthday she was told she had just two years left. But in September, as her condition worsened, she was told she would not last until December. The Mount St Joseph freshman devoted her final year to playing basketball, raising money for cancer research, and inspiring others. She played four games, raising $1.5million for pediatric cancer and leaving a legacy of fundraising that will be continued after her death. When her condition began to worsen and she became too ill to play, Hill helped out the team as a coach. Lauren Hill was a keen basketball player but she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was inoperable and significantly changed her appearance as she resolved to carry on playing in the final months of her life (right) The treatment she had significantly altered her appearance but she was determined to keep playing and raising funds for as along as she could. Before the season started, the US Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. This was noted again at the women's Final Four a week ago. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. Basketball star LeBron James posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. Hill is seen shooting a lay up during the November 2 game - her first for the Mount St Joseph's team . During her first NCAA college basketball game on November Hill gave a thumbs-up as she holds the ball . 'She made you think:"" What am I doing with my life?"" said Lexy Saraswate, 19, a Xavier student who volunteered to work at the memorial service. ""How can I be a better person?"" 'Just her courage. I felt that was the thing: What do you do when you're staring death in the face? She set a goal for herself and accomplished it, even surpassed it. She's an inspiration.' Hill's casket was brought by a hearse to Xavier's Cintas Center - the site where she made a left-handed layup to open a Division III game on November 2. The match was moved forward to this date with permission of the NCAA because of her declining condition. Hill parents, Brent (left, front) and LIsa (right) entered the Cintas Center for their daughter's memorial . Hill's high school basketball team, the Lawrenceburg Tigers, carried her jersey and a net into the memorial .

The public memorial was held at Xavier University in Cincinnati, with Hill's casket decorated with flowers . Mr and Mrs Hill (right) followed the casket at the conclusion of the hour-long memorial service in Cincinnati . The arena was packed for the game, which started with a set play to get her a left-handed layup. She also made a right-handed layup late in the game, sealing the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. The backboard and basket were off to the side, with the attached game clock and shot clock set to 22 — her number. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . Coach Dan Benjamin gently kissed her gray No. 22 jersey before stretching it over the casket. Former teammates dabbed their eyes with tissues as they sat in folding chairs on the floor. A few thousand people stood silently in the stands. 'She has revealed to us that one person can make a difference,' said Dr. Mariko DeWire, one of her physicians. 'She truly is our victorious hero.' A video of the layup she made only 17 seconds into Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 win over Hiram College in the season-opening game was also played. In a highly personal one hour ceremony songs from the basketball player's iPod were played. The second song on her playlist was James Taylor's 'You've Got A Friend.' One of her favorite songs — Katy Perry's 'Roar' — was played as her casket was wheeled out to a standing ovation. Hill will be buried in a private service on Wednesday. Family photos flanked the casket, along with a photo of her in a cape and a quote from actor Christopher Reeve: 'A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.' Hill tried to make the last months of her life about helping and inspiring other people. Through a nonprofit foundation, she helped to raise roughly $1.5 million for research into pediatric cancer. Shortly before she died, she set a goal of raising $2.2 million — matching her uniform number. Hill's team mates at Mount St Joseph University gathered to remember the teenager and her efforts . Mourners were played a video which showed her achievements during her successful basketball career . People gathered to attend the one hour long memorial service at Xavier University in Cincinnati . The fundraising campaign will continue through the school and the foundation. A number of people have praised the teenager's courage and determination as she battled her condition.

The university, in Ohio, took action after damning footage emerged of the coach touching an unidentified woman's behind on March 21. The married father-of-two was also accused of grabbing a 'woman's head and moving it toward your crotch' and calling another woman a 'b****', the same evening. A source told reporters that the incident was so heated a woman slapped him before he was asked to leave. Scroll down for video . Bowling Green basketball coach Chris Jans has been fired after witnesses say he acted 'aggressively and inappropriately' at an off-campus bar . The university took action after footage emerged of the coach touching an unidentified woman's behind on March 21 . At least 50 people reportedly saw the coach out of control before being escorted out of the bar . The video, obtained by the Toldeo Blade, was recorded by the woman's parents. They then wrote a letter to Bowling Green athletics director Christopher Kingston detailing more of his inappropriate behavior. The correspondence, obtained by Deadspin, read: 'While we were enjoying each others company we noticed on several occasions Chris Jans making what seemed to be advances towards several women. 'On one occasion he grabbed a woman’s head and pushed it downwards toward his crotch. 'A Single guy, drunk, we can possibly overlook, but certainly inappropriate for a Head Coach representing my university and most definitely not a married man with two children. I am certain she would not appreciate his behavior. 'As the night continued, we had hoped that the behavior was a fluke or a joke amongst friends ad we continued enjoying each others company until he made advances toward another female, petter her backside and proceeded to as/tell her to walk in front of him so that he could evaluate her assets.' An assistant coach reportedly helped him out of the local bar in Bowling Green, Ohio. Jans recently led the team to its first postseason win in 40 years . Fox Sports Ohio's Zac Jackson reported that he'd been in the bar perhaps three hours and the woman who struck him did not speak with either police or university officials. However a cell phone video of the incident was recorded and upwards of 50 witnesses were in the bar. No charges have been filed. According to The Washington Post, a university press release announced the termination Thursday morning. 'Jans was terminated following an investigation into his recent public conduct,' the statement read. 'The University concluded that Jans' public conduct failed to meet his obligations as a head coach and the expectations that BGSU Athletics has for its coaches.' Jans leaves the school after a single season, taking the team to its first postseason victory in 40 years. His final record there stands at 21-12. He was formerly an assistant at Wichita State before he signed with Bowling Green. His six year contract was valued at $325,000.","Chris Jans was fired for 'acting aggressively and inappropriately' at the bar on March 21 .

April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and Autism Assistance Dogs are a little known but hugely beneficial form of 'animal therapy'. It turns out man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism who may otherwise struggle to talk, communicate, walk or socialise. An 'Autism Assistance Dog' is used to keep a child with autism safe and are an incredible tool to help them develop social skills and positive relationships. The term 'Autism Spectrum Disorders' (ASD) is an umbrella term that includes Autistic disorder; Asperger's and Atypical Autism. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and people may be oblivious that man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism (stock picture) Children with autism often have difficulty with social interactions and their verbal and non-verbal communication skills may be badly affected. They can struggle to cope with change and unfamiliar environments and routines. 'The Autism Assistance Dog (AAD) Program is designed to improve the quality of life for both the child with autism and his or her family through three key areas: safety, independence and inclusion,' according to GuideDogs SA. Every child is unique meaning matching the right dog to their need's and their family is crucial. The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household. It has been reported by families participating in the Austism Assistance Dog Program that the companion can also foster positive interactions between siblings, encouraging play. The highly trained, specialised working dogs are licenced to accompany the child in essentially any location. 'An Austism Assistance Dog (AAD) has the same legal rights of access as a Guide or Hearing Dog. It is clearly identified by a coat which has securing points and a handle that the child can hold if appropriate or required,' according to GuideDogs SA. 'The purpose of the coat is to bring awareness to the special circumstances regarding the dog. This also increases the ease of access to public places by differentiating the status of an AAD from that of a pet.' The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household (stock picture) It can make family outings or even a quick trip to the shops possible where a child with autism may have struggled before. It can also give parents peace of mind as they know their child is being looked out for by a dog which has been specially trained to help their master avoid harm's way. The comfort of having their furry pooch by their side can offer a sense of stability for the child and be a calming presence on all members of the family. Children with autism 'have a high tendency to 'bolt' when they feel anxious or stressed. This is made even more alarming as they are often far less aware of danger and may not respond to direction. This can be a great challenge, requiring constant observance from their carer to ensure the child remains safe. 'On outings, the child's safety is enhanced by being connected to a coat on the dog's body, through a safety belt around the child's waist,' explained Guide Dogs SA. 'The parent has control of the dog through their own lead and will apply vocal commands to the dog. The child is encouraged to walk beside the dog but if they do choose to run off on their own, the dog is specially trained to quickly and calmly take control of the situation. 'The dog is trained to resist by sitting or lying down, acting as an ""anchor"",' GuideDogs SA explains. 'This gives the parent time to intervene and diffuse the situation.' However, the importance of this lesson is that, through the repetition, children's attempts to bolt are often reduced or completely eradicated. 'These dogs are a friend when you need one any hour of the day, every day of the year. 'They are also skilled for a few select tasks if you happen to need a hand… or a paw!'","Assistance Dogs are a little known but crucial tool for children with autism .

f3d8ddbd883ac9c727d409a8d848348a22134fc2,"Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China . Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs . Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai . The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season . ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China .","Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole .

The man, known only as Xu, even tried to impregnate the 'daughter-in-law' himself after discovering his son had not slept with his wife a single time. Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the People's Daily Online. Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties . Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China. Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (£1,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014. It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired. Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all. Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself. After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant . Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (£1,093). The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County. The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu . 'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station. This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village. 'The whole thing is pathetic and detestable,' said Guo Jialun, head of the Guanyun County police station.

The monuments of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, are recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of their unique architecture. But several of the most recognisable buildings in the city, including towers and temples, now lie in rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country yesterday morning. Scroll down for videos . Destruction: The Dharahara Tower, which was first built in 1832, has been almost completely obliterated by Nepal's earthquake . Historic: The now-destroyed tower was a UNESCO World Heritage Site until its destruction this weekend . Before: The Kathmandu Durbar Square, at the heart of Nepal's capital, is full of temples and historic houses with their distinctive roofs . After: The square is now piled with rubble after tall temples were brought down by the force of the earthquake . More than 2,500 people died in the quake as buildings collapsed raining down debris on the streets below, while enormous avalanches on Mount Everest left climbers dead. One of the most prominent landmarks to be destroyed by the earthquake was the Dharahara Tower, also known at the Bhimsen Tower, which has almost totally collapsed after more than 180 years of standing in Kathmandu. The 200ft tower was built in 1832 by prime minister Bhimsen Thapa as a gift to the queen, who was also his niece. It had to be rebuilt after a previous earthquake in 1934, but the latest disaster has left the tower as nothing more than a stump, killing scores of people who were trapped inside at the time.

Heritage: The Bhaktapur Durbar Square, pictured before the quake, is another one of the three main public spaces in the Kathmandu area . Piles: The square in Bhaktapur has rubble heaped up after its ancient temples were damaged . Kathmandu's three 'Durbar Squares', the courtyards outside the city's old royal palaces, were devastated by the earthquake, with historic temples razed to the ground by the shocks. In the largest, known as the Kathmandu Durbar Square, rubble was piled up today after a large stepped temple was obliterated in the quake. Images of the Durbar Squares in Patan and Bhaktapur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, were also devastated by the shocks. The streets of Bhaktapur were impassable because of the rubble which lay several feet deep, with fragments of religious sculptures among the stonework on the ground. In Patan, a temple had its tower broken in half, while the square was strewn with bricks. Centre: The Patan Durbar Square, pictured before the disaster, is the third major hub of the historic royal family which has been devastated . Shock: Religious sculptures were lying on the ground in Patan after the temples they were once part of collapsed . Decapitated: A statue of the Hindu deity Garud was knocked off its pedestal at Patan Durbar Square . Crooked: The stupa of a temple was almost completely ripped off by the force of the quake .

Witness: A monk surveys the aftermath of the quake, which left the main building untouched . The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the 'monkey temple' which stands on a hill above the capital, also suffered severe damage. While the complex's main golden tower was thankfully untouched, many other temple buildings were totally destroyed.

Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could. But buildings in the settlement were virtually flattened when the vortex slammed into the area at around 7pm on Thursday night. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way. Geraldine M Schultz, 67, and Jacklyn K. Klosa, 69, were killed in her home by the storm, authorities announced, while around a dozen people were injured. This aerial photo shows a path of destruction, after a tornado swept through the small town of Fairdale, Illinois . Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could . The DeKalb County Sheriff's Office bused residents back to the scene of the devastation so they could begin to take stock of what was left of their property. Seeing the wreckage up close for the first time since Thursday's storms left some amazed that they survived. 'I thought my parents were dead,' said 32-year-old Adam Davis, who hopped into his truck Thursday and raced along with the tornado in the hopes of getting to his parents' house and rescuing them before the twister struck. He found them standing in their doorway frozen in disbelief and grabbed them just in time. On Saturday, he was helping collect what could be salvaged from his childhood home, now full of debris, its roof ripped off and its windows broken. 'It's not necessarily the mementos yet; it's the essentials for now. One step at a time,' he said. Eight tornadoes roared across northern and central Illinois during Thursday's storms, the National Weather Service confirmed Saturday. The strongest hit Fairdale, where two people were killed. That tornado also injured 22 people. Debris surrounds a plot where a house once stood in the farming community. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way . The weather service gave it a preliminary EF4 rating — its second strongest — with winds of between 180 and 200 mph. It was a half-mile wide and remained on the ground for at least 28.7 miles, a record long path for that part of Illinois. Al Zammuto, a 60-year-old machinist, was preparing to inspect what was left of the roof on a former schoolhouse that he had been transforming into his home over the past year. He will have to start over. 'I don't know how much of the roof came off,' he said. 'I'm going to climb a ladder later today and see.' In all, some 70 buildings were destroyed or damaged in Fairdale, authorities said. Another 50 buildings were hit in nearby Rochelle. All buildings have been searched, but not all residents have been accounted for, so cadaver dogs are being used in parts of DeKalb County, the Illinois State Police said late Friday. The tornado blew numerous vehicles from nearby interstates, and troopers helped rescue a trapped driver in an overturned semi-trailer. As the cleanup began, tales of survival continued to emerge. The vortex created a path through the fields and wiped out a house as it made its way to the town. A building is left standing in a property above . Kelly Newman, 46, lost her Rochelle home. For her, the storm began with a moment of playful wonder at the size of the hail. She ran outside to collect some of the pieces to put it in the freezer to show her children. 'Then I noticed to the southwest there was a huge black funnel thing, but it didn't look like a tornado because it was just way too wide,' she said. But the telltale train-like roar sent them and their 19-year-old daughter running for the basement. The house cracked and collapsed around them, raining down debris and a dusting of what she described as 'muddy soot.' The family survived, and several police officers helped free her husband, who had been trapped nearly upside down between two collapsed walls. 'We're alive, we were spared. Our lives were saved,' she said. A destroyed house is seen in Fairdale is pictured on Friday, hours after a tornado ripped through the community .

After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £40million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days .

English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — Gareth Bale even — requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool’s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike Tottenham’s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player’s agent for his role in the England international’s ongoing contract saga — and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers’ criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as ‘Uncle Aidy’. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has ‘more kids than caps’ when he admits to one daughter — he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training — but denies a second child. But Sterling’s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. ‘As a young kid I had anger issues,’ Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up ‘in prison’ if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was ‘amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker’. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling’s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose ‘mentality’ was ‘his strongest attribute’. He also described him as ‘a coach’s dream’. Gallen also praised Sterling’s mother — Nadine is a nurse — for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his ‘house parents’. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling’s value to Liverpool is earning roughly £6m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; £35,000-a-week compared with £150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling’s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of £100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club’s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song ‘from the Kop’. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his ‘agent is a ****’. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don’t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don’t take the dispute into the public arena if it’s not a pay rise you’re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward’s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a ‘beautiful house’ back in Jamaica. Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?","New pictures show Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe with shisha pipes .

The 37-year-old had been missing since about 8:30am on Wednesday morning. She returned to her home near Sydney on Thursday evening, and is 'safe and well' with loved ones. Ms Bialek's husband, Sabino Matera, confirmed she was home shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday. Scroll down for video . The father of missing Sydney woman Jessica Bialek (pictured) has made a desperate plea for information about her whereabouts . 'Jessica is safe and at home. Found. Thank you,' Mr Matera posted on his Facebook account. Police have confirmed Ms Bialek returned home, and she is now speaking with officers about her disappearance. Ms Bialek's husband, Sabino Matera, confirmed she was home with a post on his Facebook page . Police thanked the public and media for their help in locating the mother-of-one. Ms Bialek had last been seen by her family when she left home to walk to the bank. The family of a photographer who vanished had earlier made a desperate plea for her to come home. Ms Bialek was last seen leaving her home on Dudley Street, in the south-eastern Sydney suburb of Coogee, about 8.30am on Wednesday. Her husband  said he spoke to her thatmorning but she has been 'out of reach since then'. On Thursday afternoon Jessica's father Michael Bialek, who had just flown in from Melbourne, fronted media to appeal for information. 'We would obviously like to appeal to anyone who may have contacted or had contact with Jess,' Mr Bialek said. Michael Bialek said he simply wants to know his daughter is safe and well, even if she wants to be alone . The search for her started after her husband posted a Facebook plea on Wednesday evening . 'We are desperate to find out from her that she's safe and if there's a reason she wants to be on her own we just want to know she's safe, that's all we're concerned about,' he added with emotion in his voice. Mr Bialek said Jessica, her husband and daughter had been visiting family in Melbourne during the Easter break before returning to Sydney on Tuesday. 'Tuesday morning was the last time.. I walked down to the lobby of our apartment building and that was the last time I saw Jess,' her distraught father revealed. Michael Bialek also described as a 'complex character as many young people are today' but added she was a loving mother, daughter and wife and he simply wanted her home. Detective Superintendent Gavin Dengate said the reason police were involved shortly after Jessica's disappearance was due to how 'out of character' it was. 'The reason is it's out of character, totally out of character for Jessica to go missing,' he said on Thursday. Police are currently working through phone records, social media, CCTV, and financial records to try and locate the woman, Detective Superintendent Dengate said.

On Wednesday Jessica's devastated husband took to social media in a plea for help in locating his missing wife, sparking a swift response from friends and the public. Sharing two pictures of his wife wearing sunglasses on the social media site, he wrote: 'Important message! As per today, Jessica has gone missing. ‘I spoke to her this morning at 8.30am and she has been out of reach since then. We are very concerned about Jessica. Please help me to find her! She left home without her car and not made contact nor returned home. Her phone is off.

49407463faf4dbabf23fe8a44a885b9d6c8f94f8,"Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson has revealed she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by People magazine on Tuesday. She explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy . 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress. 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health,' Katie Couric wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by Glenne Headly. Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Admiration: Singer Josh Groban also sent his best wishes to the actress on Twitter on Tuesday . By her side: Actress Christina Applegate also sent her love to Wilson . Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.","The 58-year-old actress revealed her diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday .

Jordan Waddingham scoured through bushland at Karoola, north east of Launceston in Tasmania to unravel  the plague of wasps after his mother Stephanie offered him $20 to locate the nest. Within minutes, the little wasp hunter made a startling discovery when he stumbled across the gigantic two-year-old nest near a creek bank after following a trail of wasps. Scroll down for video . Jordan Waddingham made a startling discovery after finding the world's largest European wasp nest . 'I followed the wasps back to their nest after they'd gone and collected wood from our sheds,' young Jordan told Seven News. Honorary Research Associate at Launceston's Queen Victoria Museum Simon Fearn told ABC it took two days to unearth the nest from the ground and four men to carry it out of the bush. 'A one-year-old nest is the size of a soccer ball, but this nest takes up the best part of a cubic metre,' he said. 'Normally European wasp nests don't survive through winter, but last year's mild, dry winter allowed it to survive into its second year.' The 12-year-old said he followed a trail of wasps when he stumbled across the gigantic 90-kilogram nest . Young Jordan's discovery is currently on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston . The 90-kilogram nest is measured at one metre tall and a circumference of three metres after it was located among a blueberry bush and destroyed overnight when the wasps were dormant. Experts believe it's the largest subterranean European wasp nest ever discovered with up to 100,000 wasps could have been living inside, Seven News reports. The nest will be on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery  in Launceston over the Easter long weekend.","A 12-year-old boy found the world's largest European wasp nest ever found .

During the interview with conservative talk show host, Mike Gallagher, the 67-year-old was asked: 'Have you seen Kelly Clarkson? You know the singer, Kelly Clarkson? Holy cow, did she blow up.' In reply, he said the 'American Idol' winner has 'a lovely voice', but added that she 'could stay off the deep dish pizza for a while'. Within minutes, Wallace's response had sparked outrage online. Now, the veteran news man has apologized for his 'offensive' remarks - which he made on the nationally-syndicated Mike Gallagher Show on Friday - in a statement obtained by DailyMail.com. SCROLL DOWN FOR 'FAT SHAMING' INTERVIEW . Firestorm: Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace (right), 67, faced wide-spread criticism after fat shaming Kelly Clarkson (left) on Friday, saying the singer and new mom could 'stay off the deep dish pizza for a while' Dealing with it: The same day, Kelly Clarkson told chat show host Ellen DeGeneres that she's had to deal with criticism about her weight since she first hit the spotlighton the first season of American Idol in 2002 . In the statement, Wallace said: 'I sincerely apologize to Kelly Clarkson for my offensive comment. I admire her remarkable talent and that should have been the focus of any discussion about her.' Clarkson, who coincidentally spoke of criticism about her weight on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the same day, is married to talent manager Brandon Blackstock. They have a nine-month-old girl, River. Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, 60-year-old Greta Van Susteren, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Gallagher. 'This ""guy snickering"" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote. Meanwhile, Twitter users condemned Wallace for his 'disgusting' remarks. One wrote: 'Chris Wallace you're disgusting how dare you fat shame a woman who gave birth less than a year ago.' During her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Clarkson revealed that since she appeared on 'American Idol' in 2002, she has had to  deal with people being mean about her body shape. On Kelly's side: Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, Greta Van Susteren (above), 60, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Mike Gallagher . Tweet: 'This ""guy snickering"" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote . Mom-and-baby bag: Ellen surprised Kelly, whose daughter River was born in June 2014, with a baby bag that dispenses 'mommy juice' after the singer said she sometimes prefers wine to workouts on Friday's show . 'I was the biggest girl in the show, too. And I wasn’t big, but people would call me big. Because I was the biggest one on Idol and I’ve kind of always gotten that,' she told the  host. Referring to British TV personality, Katie Hopkins, who has tweeted a string of rude comments about her, she added: 'People are like, I’m so sorry that lady in London was so mean to you. 'I’m like, are you serious? Like get in line.' In an interview with Access Hollywood in early March, Hopkins, 40, defended her position on the Heartbeat Song artist, declaring that 'ultimately, Kelly Clarkson is a chunky monkey.' Proud mom: The singer brought along her adorable nine-month-old daughter River and introduced her to the comedienne backstage at The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Happy and successful: Kelly's new album Piece By Piece debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Chart, making it her third number one album . But Clarkson told Ellen she feels bad not for herself but for other woman. 'I think what hurts my feelings... is that I’ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you’re big, I must be so fat to them"", she said.

c74e840c0f11dc59df851f6f7dff93841f1f4840,"A federal judge has approved a plan to resolve concussion lawsuits brought by more than 5,000 former players that could cost the league $1billion over 65 years. The deal comes after the league has been dogged for years by complaints that it long hid the risks of repeated concussions in order to return players to the field. The NFL expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia someday. The settlement approved on Wednesday by a federal judge in Philadelphia would pay them about $190,000 on average. Senior US District Judge Anita Brody (left) approved the deal on Wednesday after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. Former Philadelphia Eagles fullback Kevin Turner (right) suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease and led the lawsuit against the NFL . The settlement also includes allowing for monetary awards of up to $5million per claimant for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma. Senior U.S. District Judge Anita Brody approved the deal after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. The negotiators did not increase the original $765million plan, but agreed to remove that number as the cap. The deal means the NFL may never have to disclose what it knew when about the risks and treatment of concussions. Players' lawyers have argued that the settlement will help families get needed financial awards or medical testing that might take years if the case went to trial. The league expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia someday. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (above) has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent players from getting concussions . The league's top lawyer said Brody's approval 'powerfully underscores the fairness and propriety' of the settlement. 'Retirees and their families will be eligible for prompt and substantial benefits and will avoid years of costly litigation that — as Judge Brody's comprehensive opinion makes clear — would have an uncertain prospect of success,' NFL general counsel Jeff Pash said in a statement. The total NFL payouts over 65 years, including interest and $112million sought for lawyer fees, is expected to be more than $1billion. Critics contend the NFL is getting off lightly given annual revenues of about $10billion. However, plaintiffs would have first had to fight their way into court — instead of getting booted to NFL mediation under their players' contracts — to prevail. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually including the family of former New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau (above) Seau (above) committed suicide at his San Diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior. An autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE . 'From a business point of view, (the NFL has)...avoided what may have been the biggest risk to their continued prosperity,' said Andrew Brandt, director of the sports law program at Villanova University law school. 'Removing this as a threat is extraordinary,' he said. The NFL lawsuits, and similar suits filed later against the NHL, the NCAA and others, has fostered debate, discussion and safety reforms about sports concussions. Yet the NFL games seem to be as wildly popular as ever. 'I know people talk about, it's dangerous, and mothers won't let their sons play football. But I don't see that. I don't see that at all,' Brandt said. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually.

The NFL earlier this year said concussions have dropped by 36 per cent after they changed the way players tackle (above David Bruton #30 of the Denver Broncos lies on the ground in pain in 2014) Brody most recently asked for several tweaks, including partial credit for time played in NFL Europe and other developmental leagues, to broaden the settlement. Negotiators quickly agreed to her suggestions. She rejected other complaints raised at a November hearing, including those who say the agreement does not cover future deaths from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can only be diagnosed after death, or contemplate the day when it might be diagnosed in the living. Others oppose the award reductions for older men and those who played fewer than five years in the league. 'Although objectors insist that there must be compensation for CTE, the NFL parties were unwilling to settle claims based solely on a (diagnosis) ... rather than on manifest neurocognitive deficits,' the lead negotiators wrote in a March court filing urging Brody to approve the deal. 'Many of the behavioral and mood conditions claimed to be associated with CTE are prevalent within the general public.'","Senior US District Judge Anita Brody approved deal on Wednesday .

6e59647efef4f9d24c12aa45df46711b886f1ab9,"Students, parents and staff at a Melbourne high school are horrified after the discovery students have been drinking treated sewage water from a bubbler on campus for more than a year. In a letter sent to all parents during the school holidays, the principal of St Peter’s College in Cranbourne East, Tim Hogan admitted that ‘Class A’ recycled water had been inadvertently connected to an outdoor drinking fountain. The bubbler had been dispensing recycled water for 16 months– from December 17 2013 until April 1 2015. ‘The cross-connection came to our attention through the maintenance staff of the College on the 30th of March, 2015,’ Mr Hogan wrote in the letter, issued on April 14. Unfortunately for students, ‘Class A’ recycled water is sewage that has been treated to a standard that’s safe for watering gardens, washing clothes and flushing toilets. Students at Melbourne high school St Peter's College were drinking from a bubbling dispensing recycled water for more than a year . Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium. An investigation has been launched by the Department of Health and Human Services to assess the extent of the possible health impact on the students. The principal assured students, parents and staff that the drinking fountain was shut down on April 1 and is no longer in use. The other 20 bubblers at the school have been tested and none show traces of recycled water. The ongoing investigation will determine the number of students who have drunk from the water foundation since it became contaminated. Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption . ‘The Department has advised that drinking the Class A recycled water may have led to a slightly increased risk of gastro,’ the principal warned. However, preliminary testing of the chemicals present in the drinking water from the bubbler found that ‘the vast majority were at very low concentrations’, meaning the student were unlikely to have been harmed from consuming the water. Daily Mail Australia spoke with a number of parents of St Peter's students. All the parents were unaware of any cases of gastro or anyone who believed they'd been adversely affected by the bubbler. A Health Department official will be on site at the school on Thursday April 16 to respond to concerns the parents may have. ‘If anyone is suffering from a gastrointestinal illness and experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, they should seek advice from their GP,’ Mr Hogan advised. Families and staff are being encouraged to contact the Department of Health & Human Services on 1300 761 874.

Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his arms weakly raised in the air.In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, . Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. He later described his release as 'wonderful' and during a press conference he said he'd always dreamed of going home. His attorney said he will stay under a 7pm to 7am curfew with a couple in East Hartford. Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail . One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner. He also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference. Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole. Lapointe's lawyer and supporters said the evidence showed he could not have committed the crimes and his mental disability made him vulnerable to giving a false confession. His case became a cause celebre, receiving widespread publicity as advocates for the mentally disabled and other supporters - including writers Arthur Miller and William Styron - rallied to prove his innocence. Finally, last month the state Supreme Court ruled that Lapointe was deprived of a fair trial because prosecutors failed to disclose notes by a police officer that may have supported an alibi defense. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his weakly arms raised in the air . In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. The decision upheld an earlier ruling by the state Appellate Court, which in 2012 overturned Lapointe's convictions for capital felony murder, sexual assault and other crimes. The court ruled that Lapointe be released or given a new trial. Murder charges have been refiled but the prosecutor, Gail Hardy, said the state needs to review the evidence before deciding whether it can go forward with another trial. Lapointe is due back in court on May 15. On Friday Lapointe, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, shackles and thick glasses, was hunched over and visibly shaking as he sipped from a cup of water in court. His supporters and attorneys say Lapointe could not have committed the crime due to his disabilities. One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner - he also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference . Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole (undated inmate photo above) He suffers from Dandy-Walker syndrome, which affects brain development and causes intellectual and physical impairments. They say Lapointe, who confessed after nearly ten hours of police interrogation, was railroaded under pressure and that he barely understood what was happening to him. Lapointe's release was processed by court officials, and he was freed from custody in the afternoon. The judge rejected a request by prosecutors that Lapointe wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. Defense attorneys say their client cannot drive and is barely able to walk, therefore he does not pose a flight risk. 'We are ecstatic that after all these years Richard is finally being freed. 'This was a travesty of justice from the start,' said Kate Germond, director of Centurion Ministries, a nonprofit organization that works to vindicate people who have been wrongfully convicted. 'He will finally get to sleep in a real bed and breathe some fresh air today for the first time since his unjust incarceration,' she said.","Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, confessed to raping and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 .

Burnley were left feeling hard-done-by as referee Mike Jones denied them a couple of possible penalties and more significantly allowed Kevin Mirallas to stay on the pitch for a tackle worse than anything Barnes did. All that would be called karma in Mourinho's book. The Chelsea manager condemned the Burnley forward for a 'criminal challenge' on Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge in February when he escaped unpunished and Matic was sent off for retaliation.

On Saturday, Barnes wasn't so lucky, getting a first yellow card for an attempted sliding tackle on James McCarthy and a second for a foul on Seamus Coleman. 'It was just two silly challenges, not malicious,' said Dyche. 'But at least the referee got that one right.' That was a pithy way of explaining he was less than happy with Mr Jones for denying Burnley penalties for a John Stones challenge on Barnes and an attempt by McCarthy to bring down Scott Arfield. And he was furious that Mirallas stayed on the pitch for a high lunge on George Boyd early in the second half. 'That was the biggest one. It's impossible he stays on the football pitch for a challenge like that,' said Dyche. 'High, late. I've no clue why it wasn't a red card. 'I don't want to see players surround referees. We don't. Maybe we should because other teams would have done after the Mirallas challenge. 10 v 10 is a lot easier than 10 v 11 and we would have fancied our chances.' Predictably, Everton boss Roberto Martinez had an opposite viewpoint. 'I don't think it was a red card at all. He stands on his feet in the challenge. It was well-controlled,' he added before slightly contradicting himself. 'It was a typical striker's challenge.'

Burnley No 1 Heaton blows a sigh of relief after preventing Everton from taking the lead . Decisions aside, it was clear Everton were the better team on the pitch and deserved the victory given to them after 29 minutes when Arouna Kone dummied Seamus Coleman's cross and Mirallas finished at the second attempt for his 10th goal of the season. They had already missed a penalty from Ross Barkley by that stage. Burnley's Tom Heaton was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers and when the visitors had a late chance to equalise, it fell to out-of-sorts Danny Ings who headed Kieran Trippier's cross wide. Burnley's brave battle against the drop is in danger of running out of steam, perhaps due to Dyche's policy of naming unchanged teams. Leicester's win leaves The Clarets bottom of the table having scored only one goal in seven matches. They face Leicester next weekend and it's a must-win, . If they been spurred on by the record-breaking Test cricket achievements in the Caribbean of Burnley fan Jimmy Anderson, it didn't show. After ten minutes, David Jones pulled down Aaron Lennon on the edge of the box and they both fell inside. Baines, whose Premier League record from the spot is 15 out of 16, didn't take it. Barkley did and the effort was saved by Heaton with Martinez unconvincingly stating afterwards he applauded the youngster's confidence for stepping up. At least it didn't deny Everton a win as Mirallas had done when he grabbed the ball of Baines against West Brom in January and missed his penalty. 'I was very pleased with the overall performance. The scoreline shows you a clean sheet and we had 20 attempts to score,' said Martinez whose side could still finish a moderate season in the top half of the table. Burnley would bite your hand off at 17th and Dyche still believes in the great escape. 'I thought we were decent in the first half and excellent in the second when we were a man down.'

Despite the fact Toure turns 32 next month, Roberto Mancini is so desperate to sign the powerful midfielder that he's ready to give the Ivory Coast midfielder a deal that will see him play beyond his 37th birthday. Mancini, who signed Toure for Manchester City in 2010, is working hard behind the scenes to bring Toure to Serie A next season.

The midfielder's representatives are fully aware of Inter's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer. City want to keep Toure, who currently earns £220,000-per-week, and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season, which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over. But Inter will test City's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England.

40f45f768f7468726ce0385faf41f917060ec59d,"An exotic animal owner from Ohio is campaigning for his bear and big cats to be returned after they were seized by the state in January. In total, six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger (part lion, part tiger) were taken from Kenny Hetrick's Stony Ridge farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were 'unsafe'. Authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of  wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern Ohio released 56 exotic animals - including lions and  tigers - then killed himself. Apparently Hetrick has been heartbroken by the clampdown on his farm and the 72-year-old widower is now fighting to overturn the seizure, backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie doesn't pose a threat. Scroll down for video . Feeling lost: Kenny Hetrick is campaigning for his tigers, leopards and bears to be returned after they were seized by the state in January . They have organized car washes and handed him envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars to pay legal bills. Some spent the winter shoring up his cages with taller fences and netting, hoping the animals will return. 'He's lost without them,' said Josh Large, who lives four houses away. 'A lot of us are lost without them.' Hetrick allowed anyone to visit at no charge, getting by with help from volunteers and donations of cash, as well as of deer and horse meat to feed his animals. He thought of himself as an educator, inviting scout troops and families to learn what they wouldn't hear at zoos. Flashback: In total six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger were taken from Hetrick's farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit - here he is seen in 2014 with his pet bear . However, the 2011 incident mentioned earlier pushed Ohio to tighten regulations on 'private zoos'. Owners are now required to have sturdy cages, background checks and insurance before receiving an annual permit. Since the beginning of last year, Ohio has issued permits to 54 exotic animal enthusiasts. Others gave up their animals or moved them out of state rather than make the changes. 'I know I didn't have everything done, but I thought they'd work with me,' said Hetrick, who acknowledged before his animals were taken that he couldn't afford everything the state wanted. The agriculture department says that it tried, but that he never responded to letters sent over a span of two years with the permit application materials until last October, nine months after the deadline, when it gave him ten days to surrender his animals. State officials in January rejected his application for a permit, which includes a $1,000 fee, saying it submitted was too late. They also said state inspectors who visited the sanctuary outside Toledo last November discovered the tigers could stand on their housing and get dangerously near the top of their cages. The inspection noted there were unsecured padlocks and chains and not enough fencing around an enclosure holding a tiger and black leopard. 'If motivated, it would be very easy for either of those two animals to escape,' said Melissa Simmerman, assistant state veterinarian. Hetrick, whose pickup truck has 'Tiger Man' painted on the side, disputes those assertions. 'Nothing's ever got loose. Not in almost 40 years,' he said. 'Nobody's ever been bit. Nobody's been hurt.' Empty: A sign affixed to a cage at Tiger Ridge Exotics in Stony Ridge, Ohio, indicates that it is the home of Cody the bear - Cody and 10 other exotic animals were seized by the state in January . Lonesome: Only Chief the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law . The Ohio Department of Agriculture has a duty to protect the public's safety, spokeswoman Erica Hawkins said. 'Just because an animal's never gotten out, doesn't mean that an animal couldn't get out,' she said. Hetrick is appealing the department's rejection of his permit application and a hearing is scheduled for next week, but the fight will probably continue in court no matter what a state panel decides. Until then, the ten animals - a lion named Leo that had been in failing health was euthanized by the state last week - will remain a two-hour drive away outside Columbus, in a high-security building operated by the state. 'Today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at Tiger Ridge Exotics who have been held illegally and long neglected. Now, it's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo—a potentially life-threatening move. This is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need. PETA is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first.' Source: Toledo News Now . Supporters of Hetrick believe the animals - only the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law - have been mistreated and will not survive long outside their home. State officials insist they are fine. Hetrick doesn't have formal training with wild animals, but he has been around them about 60 years, since he was a ten-year-old volunteer cleaning cages at a zoo in Tarpon Springs, Florida. His love for wild creatures grew when he moved to Ohio. He first brought home an ocelot, often called a dwarf leopard. 'I tell people don't start with a tiger if you don't know what you're doing,' he said. He and his wife, who died four years ago, spent much of the money he made as an auto worker and police officer on the animals. Even with donations, food alone for the tigers and others cost as much as $15,000 annually in recent years. Their collection multiplied, often when others dropped off unwanted pets. His daughter, Corrina Hetrick, remembers going out to catch the school bus only to find an alligator swimming in a kiddie pool. There also was the time a black panther showed up in the back of a pickup truck. 'I didn't have cats and dogs,' she said. 'I had bears and tigers.' Even the circus camped at his two-acre property while traveling between shows. 'We had elephants in the backyard and contortionists in the living room,' she said. Erica Crawford, who has been visiting Hetrick's animals since she was a little girl and now brings her children, said she appreciates the uniqueness of the place. 'There's never been a time,' she said, 'where I felt like it's not safe there.'","In total, six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger (part lion, part tiger) were taken from Kenny Hetrick's Stony Ridge farm .

Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor, who claims to be fighting with Islamic State in Syria, posted a video on YouTube in an attempt to incite violent acts in Australia and New Zealand during services commemorating Anzac Day's centenary. In the video, which has since been removed after 3 News notified authorities, Taylor instructed fellow jihadists to act out against police and soldiers. 'Now is the time to commence your operations, even if it means you have to stab a few police officers, soldiers on Anzac Day and so be it.' Scroll down for video . Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor has posted a video to Youtube urging IS sympathisers to attack Anzac Day services in Australia and New Zealand . New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed Taylor was 'known to New Zealand authorities' and that this was not his first attempt at publicly 'airing his views'. Mr Bush said police had conducted a thorough assessment of the troubling video and he was satisfied all appropriate measures had been put into place to protect those who plan on attending Anzac Day services. 'We take our responsibility for the safety and security of New Zealanders very seriously and, while we are unable to go into detail, we have already taken further security measures.' Police in New Zealand have confirmed they have implemented extra security measures amid growing concerns of a targeted terror attack . 'Zealanders should feel confident in attending Anzac Day events as planned, while exercising their usual vigilance in light of the current global security environment,' Mr Bush said. Prime Minister John Key told 3 News the troubling video only further confirms that IS are a growing threat to New Zealand and its people. 'It just reaffirms what I've been saying, that IS is a war that they are trying to bring to New Zealand.' Mr Key told reporters that while IS enjoy 'inciting fear' by publicising the atrocities they commit, the group are under extreme scrutiny. 'Those people are under…a pretty significant watch from the authorities, so we will continue to watch those people very, very closely.' 'It just reaffirms what I've been saying, that IS is a war that they are trying to bring to New Zealand' 'Now is the time to commence your operations, even if it means you have to stab a few police officers, soldiers on Anzac Day and so be it' Taylor, who left in May 2012 despite having his passport cancelled, is one of very few New Zealanders who are known to be fighting for Islamic State militants in Syria. He reportedly burned his passport upon crossing the Syrian boarder and posted to Facebook that his move to Syria was a 'one-way trip, no going back', the Guardian reported. Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location in Syria to the whole world. While some claimed he did this unknowingly branding him the 'bumbling jihadi', Taylor said he had 'every intention' to display his location.

Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location to the world . This comes only weeks after an Anzac Day terror plot was foiled by Australian authorities when 200 officers raided properties in south east Melbourne. Five men were arrested and it was revealed they were allegedly plotting to run over a police officer, savage him with a knife and steal his gun so they could embark on a shooting rampage in the streets of Melbourne on Anzac Day. Two of the five men arrested in the pre-dawn raids remain in custody, including Sevdet Besim, 18, of Hallam, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court . A second 18-year-old man, of Hampton Park in Melbourne's southeast, was being held under a Preventative Detention Order, which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days. A British teenager was also arrested on suspicion of helping to plot the ISIS-inspired attack during Anzac Day commemorations. A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire, allegedly communicated with Australian men who had planned to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day.

Doctors say they are stunned with how healthy Luke Shambrook appeared, considering he had gone without food or water since Good Friday. Sitting up in his hospital bed, the young boy is seen flanked by two people from the search and rescue team who made the dramatic find on Tuesday, just three kilometres from where he went missing at Lake Eildon National Park, northeast of Melbourne. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was lost for four nights alone in the Victorian bushland and on Wednesday he was reunited with his rescuers at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne . Luke is with his family at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and was suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and hypothermia when he was found. He is unlikely to suffer any long term effects from his traumatic ordeal. Paediatrician Amy Gray said Luke was still a bit weak and tired, but asking for food. 'It's an amazingly happy outcome after what has clearly been an incredibly stressful, traumatic experience,' she said on Wednesday. 'I don't know that any of us know exactly what he's been through, but ... we think he's doing fabulously for someone who has been through what we can only imagine, and certainly in much better condition than what we'd expect.' The 11-year-old autistic boy was found just three kilometres away from where went missing at Lake Eildon National Park - north-east of Melbourne . A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fourth day of an increasingly desperate search . A police officer was first on the site, and he knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe . Dr Gray said he was improving with each hour and doctors did not expect him to have any ongoing physical problems from the ordeal. 'Aside from the dehydration he's tired and weak, again as you would expect, but there's no other real major physical issues at this stage,' she said. 'He seems very content and settled in the ward and happily interacting with the family.' A desperate search for Luke was mounted after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday. Other rescuers quickly followed, with one wrapping the terrified boy in a foil blanket, before he was gently taken from the bush to where he could receive proper medial attention . It ended on Tuesday when a police helicopter guiding on-ground searchers to Luke's location and captured the moment on dramatic video, . Luke is seen peering out from behind trees before a uniformed police officer him and appears to take his hand to reassure him he was finally safe. Then other rescuers join the scene, with one of them unfolding a foil blanket and wrapping it around the boy's shoulders. Luke's autism and limited speech could mean he never reveals what happened. 'He may have been wandering around lost and clocking up the k's,' Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Rick Nugent told Fairfax Radio on Wednesday. Luke Shambrook has been found alive after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday . He suffered from dehydration and hypothermia but has been reunited with his mother Rachel (pictured left) His parents Tim and Rachel were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance in a stretcher, with his mother giving him a kiss . Luke was found just before midday AEST on Tuesday in bushland off Skyline Road, 3km from the campsite . 'I'm not sure we'll ever know.' Mr Nugent on Tuesday said Luke's survival in the cold, wet, rugged terrain was a miracle. SES spokesman Brent Sergeant said the more days that passed during the search for Luke, the harder it became for volunteers. But finding the boy's beanie on Monday and realising he had walked away from water, rather than toward it, lifted their spirits.

c403be583eca4195413b8a20e76c7a0f03440b2e,"Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet to the head nearly two months after going missing in may 2014 . Nearly a year after North Dakota college student Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet in the head, his mother still struggles with how her shy son who liked to bowl and belonged to a club of electricity enthusiasts got mixed up in the dangerous world of illegal drugs. Tammy Sadek believes the answer is that her 20-year-old son signed his own death warrant when he agreed to become a confidential informant for police after they caught him selling marijuana. Authorities say he knew what he was getting into and agreed to help them of his own free will. Still, people who knew Sadek are shocked by what happened. 'He was a gentle soul,' said Kristi Brandt, principal of Valley City High School, from which Sadek graduated. Investigators haven't concluded whether Sadek was slain or killed himself. Adding to the mystery, a gun that fires the same caliber bullet that killed Sadek is missing from their family farm near the tiny town of Rogers. An autopsy concluded that Sadek died of the gunshot wound, and that he had no drugs or alcohol in his system. How his body ended up in the Red River has not been explained and no gun was found. An investigative report from two-and-half months ago said the drug task force which recruited Sadek acted appropriately. But his death is raising questions about the use of young, low-level drug offenders as confidential informants and if they should they be given more detailed information about the dangers. Sadek had been working with a drug task force as a confidential informant after he was caught selling marijuana on campus in 2013.  His mother, Tammy Sadek believes that he signed his death warrant when he began working for the force . The circumstances surrounding the death of Sadek, who was a second-year student at the State College of Science, still remain unknown . American Civil Liberties Union spokeswoman Jennifer Cook said informants are doing a dangerous part of law enforcement, without the training. 'The safety risks associated with informant use can far outweigh the benefits,' she said. Sadek was a second-year electrical technician student at the State College of Science, a two-year community college in the southeastern North Dakota city of Wahpeton where about 3,600 students study everything from diesel technology to performing arts. He enjoyed lake activities and golfing in addition to bowling and electrical work while growing up on the family farm. Brandt said Sadek was never a troublemaker in high school, and was always polite and respectful of authority. She doubted his nature changed much in college. 'Sometimes there are changes, but usually it's more on the level of a maturity change, not necessarily a personality change,' she said. He wanted an electrical technician master's degree, but his plans began to go awry in April 2013 when he twice sold marijuana to a confidential informant. Both transactions were small - for a total of $80 worth of drugs - but they took place on campus, making them serious felonies. In November 2013, agents with the Southeast Multi-County Agency Drug Task Force searched Sadek's dorm room and said they found a grinder containing marijuana residue. Though investigators have not found the weapon or made arrests in Sadek's death, his mother Tammy believes he would not have killed himself . The next day, Sadek - facing the prospect of drug charges that could land him in prison for 41 years - completed paperwork to become a confidential informant. The attraction of cooperating with authorities is that it offers the chance to keep a felony off the record of a young person, said Wahpeton Police Chief Scott Thorsteinson. Richland County Deputy Sheriff Jason Weber, now the interim task force supervisor, won't say whether Sadek was specifically told of the dangerous nature of the work he would be doing. The document that Sadek signed to become a confidential informant did not explicitly state the potential risks. Drug investigators need to be more explicit about those dangers, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project. 'You have to really say, ""This is the risk: You're entering a world that's dangerous, and you might end up dead,""' Harrington said. Sadek bought drugs three times for the regional task force over the next three months, one short of the four purchases required of him. Officials have said that confidential drug informants, who are often young and low-level drug offenders, need to be more educated of the dangers that come with the job . A security camera videotaped Sadek leaving his dormitory early on May 1, 2014. He wasn't seen again. His body was found in the river about two months later. Authorities estimate that he had died two days after he disappeared. Officials with the North and South Dakota state crime bureaus and a Cass County sheriff's detective reviewed the task force's involvement with Sadek and said in their late January report that they 'did not see anything that caused concern.' 'That's how drug task forces work all over the world,' said Weber, the task force supervisor. 'You're always constantly trying to find the bigger person and go to that person's supplier.' But Tammy Sadek believes that even though the probe was billed as independent, members of the law enforcement community 'have each other's back'. She has a point, according to John Burton, a California attorney and vice president of the National Police Accountability Project. Colleges have faced scrutiny for allowing police to use students as confidential informants, while Sadek's mother has questioned whether officers pressured her son . 'It's just a charade when they do these things,' Burton said of law enforcement agencies investigating one another. U.S. Justice Department guidelines state that authorities should consider the risk of harm to a potential l informant, but do not say that the person should be informed of the risks. North Dakota Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Liz Brocker declined to comment on any policies or procedures that might be in place for drug task forces in the state. Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School professor Alexandra Natapoff said the use of criminal informants 'is almost entirely unregulated' across the country, though that is beginning to change. The Florida Legislature in 2009 passed 'Rachel's Law,' requiring police to adopt policies to protect informants, after 23-year-old Rachel Hoffman was shot to death in 2008 while working as an informant. That law is 'only the beginning of the protections that we need for young, vulnerable informants,' Natapoff said. Tammy Sadek believes her son was scared into becoming a confidential informant. She's started a Justice for Andrew Sadek Facebook page that has more than 3,200 likes. 'I would like to see (task forces) stop using kids,' she said. 'I know it's common, but these are just little fish.'","Andrew Sadek, 20, was working for a narcotics task force after being caught dealing small amounts of marijuana, according to a report .

72ce30f278e680cd1aa8bbeb0a2f73d61ad2cfa0,"A mother of two who works as a high-class escort has told how she received 'a torrent of abuse from the thinly pursed lips of apparently ""better"" mothers' when she revealed her double life on national television. Amanda Goff, known to her clients as Samantha X, is a former journalist wrote a book about her experience after becoming a global sensation. In her new book, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, the 40-year-old said she was shocked her revelation garnered so much attention from the media, with interview requests flooding in from news organisations all over the world. After being labelled ‘a whore and a s*** and an anti-feminist’, Ms Goff said the most troubling part of her ‘coming out’ experience was the response she received from other mothers, who expected her children to ‘endure a life of misery’ because of her abnormal profession. Scroll down for video . Former journalist Amanda Goff appeared on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X . ‘The fact I had kids caused a torrent of vitriolic abuse spouting from the thinly pursed lips of apparently ‘better’ mothers than me who thought my role in society was awful, tutting my ‘poor, poor’ children and raging about what a terrible, selfish mother I was, and how because of my job, my kids would have to endure a life of misery, bullying and shame (probably from their own kids),’ she wrote. Although Ms Goff, who has worked at New Idea, InStyle and Prevention magazines, knew her story would one day become ‘old news’, she said she felt physically sick in the weeks following her revelation. After a stern talking to from a close friend, Ms Goff said she decided to ‘toughen up’ and start focusing on the people in her life who she thought really mattered. The mother-of-two said her harshest critics were other mothers concerned with the ‘life of misery’ her children were expected to endure . ‘The people who loved me knew who I was. I adored my kids, and my kids adored me. I was a good person, a good mum, a good friend.’ Ms Goff said she was glad she has been able to tell her story and reveal the ‘emotional turmoil’ and ‘torture’ she faced after she outed herself as an escort. She explained that among the negativity, she also received many messages of 'kindness' and 'support'. Some even told her they were inspired to leave their mundane jobs to pursue a career in the sex industry. Ms Goff claims her job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones . Goff said she is not ashamed of her decision to go public and says she is the 'happiest' she has ever been . ‘They want to thank me for going public and making them realise it was okay to like sex, and want to get paid for it,’ she said. Not only did Ms Goff receive support from those who wanted to follow in her footsteps, she was also commended for her strength and courage by women who already worked in the sex industry. While she copped a lot of flack for admitting she worked in the sex industry, Ms Goff said her job as a sex worker, was more ethical than her former career as a journalist where she was asked to hide in bushes and illegally hack phones. Discussing her personal life, Ms Goff confirmed her ex partner and the father of her children had known about her x-rated career ‘for yonks’ and although he did not support it, she had never deceived him about it. Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha (right) told Daily Mail Australia that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity . Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with Mr Basha - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X . Hooked: Amanda Goff reveals why she decided to out herself as a high-class escort and what happened after her big secret became a global sensation . Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha, told Daily Mail Australia last year that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity. He said: 'It's a disgrace. I have had to explain to my kids what's going on. I'm worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.' After cutting ties with her former flame and coming out as an escort, Ms Goff said Samantha X was inundated with requests and claimed she could have pocketed a ‘million dollars’ if she'd have seen every person who inquired. However, after enduring months of public scrutiny, Ms Goff said her time as an escort was coming to an end. She said that while she would miss the extravagant lifestyle, at this stage in her life, she had become more concerned with finding a long-term partner. ‘Samantha X is afraid of love,’ she revealed. ‘I am sick of being afraid. I am sick of sleeping alone.’ If you want to learn more about Amanda Goff's story you can read about it in her tell all book Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort.","Former journalist Amanda Goff has spoken out about her life as an escort .

5cf60d716cedff9d2408ff256912e8794fc8b0da,"An impoverished father has revealed that he plans to sell his own kidney to fund life-saving treatment for his three morbidly-obese children. Sisters Yogita Rameshbhai Nandwana, five, and Anisha, three, and their 18-month-old brother Harsh, are among the world's heaviest young children. Weighing 5st 5lbs (34kg), 7st 8lbs (48kg) and 2st 5lbs (15kg) respectively, the food they eat in a week is enough to feed two families in a month. Now their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 34, of Gurjarat, India, is planning to sell his kidney to earn the money needed to see top specialists. He said: ‘If my kids continue to grow at this rapid rate they will have major health issues. We’re terrified they will die.’ Scroll down for video . Obese: (From left) Yogita, five, Harsh, 18 months, and Anisha, three, weigh 5st 5lbs (34kg), 2st 5lbs (15kg) and 7st 8lbs (48kg) respectively . Yogita and Anisha eat 18 chapatis, 3lbs of rice, two bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits, 12 bananas and a litre of milk daily. And their extreme hunger means their mother Pragna Ben, 30, spends most of her day making their meals. She said: ‘My day starts with making 30 chapatis and 1kg vegetable curry in the morning. After that I am again in the kitchen preparing more food. ‘Their hunger never stops. They demand food all the time and cry and scream if they’re not fed. I am always in the kitchen cooking for them.’ The couple have one older daughter, Bhavika, six, who weighs an average 2st 7lbs (16kg), and do not know why their other three children are so big. Mr Nandwana said: ‘When Yogita was born she was extremely weak and weighed just 1.5kg (3.3lbs). We were worried for her health. 'So we fed her a lot during the first year of her life to build her strength but by her first birthday she had bloated to 12kg (1st 12lbs). Family: Rameshbhai Nandwana (left), 34, and Pragna Ben (back right), 30, are the parents of Yogita (front left), Anisha (front right), Harsh (front centre) and six-year-old Bhavika (rear centre), their other daughter - who weighs an average 2st 7lbs. They all live together in Gujarat, India . ‘Our third daughter Anisha also gained weight in similar fashion and by her first birthday she was 15kg. ‘But we only realised they were suffering from a disorder when our son Harsh was born as he too gained weight quickly during his first year. 'We started looking for medical help and consulted many doctors but they would just refer us to bigger hospitals that I couldn’t afford.’ Mr Nandwana earns just Rs 3000 (£35) a month - but usually has sufficient money to buy enough food to fulfil the large appetite of his children. He said: ‘I am a daily wage labour and I usually get paid Rs 100 a day but there are times when there is no work at all. ‘I work in fields, dig wells, and do whatever menial job I can find to earn money. 'And I’m constantly worried about finding the money to feed my continually hungry children.’ Despite his paltry income, Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (£110) a month on food for his children and said he 'cannot leave them starving' Diet: Yogita and Anisha eat eight chapatis, 4lbs of rice, three bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits and 12 bananas daily .

Six wheat chapatis . One litre of milk . Buttermilk (1.5 litres) Two big bowls of vegetables . He added: ‘If I don’t have the money, I borrow it from my brothers and friends. But I make sure I feed my children when they need.’ The father has spent Rs 50,000 (£540) on seeing doctors and treatment over the last three years – without any improvement in his children’s condition. He said: ‘No one in our family has a giant frame. Only my children are overweight. As parents, it pains us immensely to see them unable to move. ‘They cannot walk; they cannot do anything on their own. Selling my kidney is a desperate measure. But I’m now desperate to get the right help for my children.’ Miss Ben cannot pick up her children so she has to watch them roll around when her husband is at work - or use a trolley to pull them around. She said: ‘They need me to help them bath or when they need the toilet. I’m only 40 kg so it’s impossible for me to pick them up. ‘It’s a struggle when my husband is at work. Hard-working: Anisha hugs her father Rameshbhai, with Harsh. Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (£110) a month on food for his children . 'They are usually restricted to the same place for the whole day and because of that, they cannot go to school. 'All they do all day is eat and play and giggle with each other. 'I want my daughters to get an education and play like other kids. I want them to have a life. This is no life.’ Local doctors believe the children are suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, but do not know how to treat it. The rare genetic condition causes various symptoms including constant hunger, reduced muscle tone, restricted growth and learning difficulties. Dr Akshay Mandavia, a paediatrician at Mandavia Children's Hospital in Gujarat, said: ‘There is an abnormal accumulation of fat in these children. ‘They’re not able to breathe properly, and they wheeze. Their condition could be due to endocrinal disease or Prader-Willi syndrome. ‘But we can only ascertain the right treatment after a proper diagnosis at one of our top hospitals.’ Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems. These include: . It is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome number 15, which happens purely by chance, and is usually diagnosed by carrying out genetic tests. Sadly, there is no cure for the condition. Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems such as overeating. Parents of children with the condition usually have to restrict their diet and lock up all food . Instead, a team of healthcare professionals will help teach parents to manage any problems the child has, such as overeating. Children usually want to eat frequently, so it is important that most of the food they eat is low in calories, and that access to sweets and fatty foods is restricted. Getting the child to stick to an eating plan voluntarily is practically impossible, so parents usually need to lock any storage areas that contain foods, such as fridge or cupboards. They should also search the child’s room for hidden foods, forbid them to leave the house unsupervised, or play with other children who are eating food, in case they try to steal it. Any family, friends or teachers should be informed of the need to restrict their diet. The child should also be encouraged to exercise as much as possible. If the child has restricted growth, treatment with an artificial version of the human growth hormone (HGH) is usually recommended, as it can increase their final adult height by around 10.5cm (4.1 inches). Most adults with Prader-Willi syndrome are unable to live fully independent lives, such as having a full-time job and living in their own home. Their behavioural issues and problems with food mean these environments and situations are too demanding. Adults with the syndrome who don't live with their parents will probably require residential care. Source: NHS Choices .

122337044e34f279f3bfac270816b52e4d323af1,"Ronald Koeman is looking forward to this weekend's 'special' match against Tottenham, ahead of which the Southampton manager praised the 'great job' predecessor Mauricio Pochettino did at St Mary's. The former Argentina defender ended a 16-month stint on the south coast last summer to sign a five-year deal at White Hart Lane. Pochettino's exit was the catalyst to an unparalleled talent drain from St Mary's, although successor Koeman has not only steered the club to calmer waters but to new heights. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has praised the work of his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino at the club .

Southampton full-back Nathaniel Clyne (left) tussles for possession with Stoke's Steven Nzonzi (right) Stoke forward Jonathan Walters dribbles ahead of Southampton's Maya Yoshida (right) in their last game . Koeman had to cope with several player sales at Southampton, including Luke Shaw to Manchester United . Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana (right) was also sold to Liverpool shortly after Koeman arrived at the club . With five matches remaining, Saints are just a point and a place worse off than Spurs in sixth and can usurp them in the European spots with victory in Saturday's early kick-off. 'Everybody was afraid because we had to make a lot of changes in the team,' Koeman told reporters. 'But I think the quality of the players that we brought in were good, at a good level. I think the rest of the players had really a good aspiration and ambition to do a good season, to play a good season at a good level. 'Now we are fighting for a high position in the table. There's still five games to play and a very nice one this Saturday afternoon. 'It is Tottenham, the difference is only one point and, okay, for the fans maybe it makes it a little bit more special because Mauricio is now the coach and was the coach of Southampton. 'He is the coach of the opponent this Saturday, so that makes it special but the game will be decided between the white lines.' Koeman was speaking at St Mary's after meeting Barclays Spirit of the Game hero Tina Croucher, who was being rewarded for her community work at the club. The Southampton manager and midfielder Victor Wanyama answered questions from a handful of supporters as part of the event, where talk of Pochettino was rarely far away. Koeman says his return along with the potential implications of the result makes Saturday's match the biggest at St Mary's since he took the reins. A positive result would see Saints break their record Premier League points haul set last year by Pochettino, although he is unlikely to get a particularly warm reception. The former Argentina defender's departure left a sour taste with many Southampton fans, whose travelling support gave him a taster of what to expect at White Hart Lane earlier in the season. 'Sometimes if you go as a Barcelona player to Madrid the reception is difficult, and sometimes in Holland,' Koeman said, when asked if he has such a bad reception. 'But, okay, I think the reception for Mauricio normally has to be good because he did a great job for Southampton. 'I like him as a person and as a coach and we have a good contact.' Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama (centre) shields the ball from Swansea players back in September . There certainly does not appear any bad blood between Koeman and Pochettino, despite the latter suggesting earlier in the year that he handed the Dutchman an easy job at Southampton. Koeman took those comments in his stride, joking at the time that he only came to Southampton 'to have a nice little holiday'. Now, just days before the game, the Saints boss gave a more serious answer, praising his Spurs counterpart for the legacy he left at St Mary's. 'I think they make the beginning (of this) and developed the quality of the players, the young players,' Koeman said.

During a tumultuous day of proceedings at a corporate tax inquiry in Sydney today, News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke was peppered with questions from Greens senator and party leader Christine Milne about why The Australian newspaper operates as a business when it is not profitable. When Mr Clarke defended the newspaper as the 'finest national newspaper operating in Australia', Ms Milne flatly told the inquiry, 'you and I won't agree on that'. 'You're a minority,' Mr Clarke fired back. 'Not from the number of people who buy your newspaper,' Ms Milne responded. Scroll down for video . A fiery stoush erupted News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss . Clarke was peppered with questions from Greens senator Christine Milne about why The Australian newspaper continued to when it is not profitable . As Christine Milne made her opinion about The Australian newspaper clear, News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke fired back: 'You're a minority' 'Not according to sales,' Greens Senator Christine Milne responded . 'I'm sorry?' Mr Clarke asked. 'How many do we sell a day? 'You sell a very small number,' Ms Milne responded. Mr Clarke also rejected allegations recently published by Fairfax Media alleging $4.5 billion had been siphoned from Mr Murdoch's Australian operations to the United States virtually tax free. He told the hearing the report was 'hopelessly wrong', arguing the stories were 'either deliberately misleading or no idea; looking at the author (business correspondent Michael West), I would say both'. In her questioning, Ms Milne also alleged The Australian was run for ideological purposes. Mr Clarke, who argued the paper examined policy, accepted her contention. It has been previously reported that the national broadsheet lost $30 million in the 2012/13 financial year. The paper was reportedly hoping to half that loss in the 2013/14 financial year. Also at Wednesday's hearing, the inquiry panel heard that the Australian arms of technology giants Google, Apple and Microsoft are being audited by the Australian Tax Office.

Google Australia managing director Maile Carnegie said the company made $58 million in revenue in 2013, and profits of just more than $46 million, but paid $7.1 million in tax. Earlier, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan continued to refuse to reveal the identities of a number of companies suspected of avoiding tax by shifting billions of dollars offshore. Committee chairman Sam Dastyari had written to Mr Jordan on Tuesday requesting he reveal the names. But Mr Jordan refused, and in a response sent to Senator Dastyari and tabled at the hearing on Wednesday, defended the decision on the grounds that naming the companies would undermine public confidence in the tax system. 'The Treasurer has been consulted about making these PII (public interest immunity) claims, and has endorsed them being made by me as an independent statutory office holder. The grounds of the PII claim are as follows,' the letter said.

ba1436809e689c3fdb97f9da8efd404f4d070920,"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn't looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting. And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling him out for his 'bullying' behavior. 'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. 'It's the one thing that never seems to change.' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued. 'I wanna know how you know that. Because you're a teacher, and you're standing in front of students every day, conveying to them, facts - things that they need to learn. So I would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long, court case, that you have enough detail to know.' Mooney explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting 'to be bullied'. 'You're not being bullied, because you're asking me a question, I'm going to ask you questions back,' Christie says, as he continues to dodge the issue. 'He said, ""I'm not bullying you' as he bullied her,""' Wollmer said of the exchange. Perhaps the reason why Wollmer and his union responded sharply to Christie's town hall meeting Tuesday night, is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system. 'The fact is your union, over the course of time, has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford,' Christie said Tuesday.","The presidential hopeful held a town hall meeting in Kenilworth on Tuesday .

ce4ec559af20e25a4413d6c695046497a10ccd4c,"Controversial Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary claims the budget airline will slash its fares by as much as 15 per cent over the next two years. The chief executive of Europe’s largest budget airline made the vow in an interview with a French weekly newspaper, saying its average fare could be as low as €40 (approximately £26) next year. It would be a €6 (£4) decrease from Ryanair’s current average ticket price, with Mr O’Leary attributing the anticipated fare cuts to lower oil prices. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary took aim at Air France in his interview with Le Journal du Dimanche . Famed for his combative management style, Mr O’Leary told Le Journal du Dimanche the Dublin-based discount carrier will pass the oil savings on to customers and claimed most European airlines have an average ticket price of €170 for a short flight. He said Ryanair expects to grow its passenger numbers and cut costs with new Boeing aircraft that will have more seats and reduce fuel consumption by an average of 18 per cent – without compromising passenger safety or security. In his interview with the Sunday newspaper the airline boss, who has made strides to soften his image, took shots at Air France, touting Ryanair as a cheaper and more reliable airline. He ridiculed Air France for last year’s pilots’ strike, which reportedly cost the Paris-based carrier hundreds of millions of pounds, predicted more troubled times and accused the airline of impeding growth at regional airports. An Air France spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that the airline is not responding to Mr O'Leary's comments. Michael O'Leary said he despises the 'French political class', but loves France and the French . Mr O’Leary was put on the defensive several times in the wide-ranging interview, as he disputed claims that Ryanair staff face poor working conditions and wages. The chief executive claimed there is a waiting list of 300 pilots and nearly 1,000 flight attendants who want to work for Ryanair. He told the newspaper: ‘All the things we hear about Ryanair are nonsense. Many companies such as Air France cut jobs. We create, we increase salaries and we pay pension contributions.’ Mr O’Leary also had to explain his feelings towards the French, telling Le Journal du Dimanche that he ‘despises the French political class’ that ‘destroyed the economy’, but loves France and the French. The airline boss disputed claims that Ryanair staff face poor working conditions and wages . He defended Ryanair’s decision not to employ workers in France year-round, saying it is due to the ‘administrative madness’ of labour laws and taxation. Ryanair has long faced complaints of poor customer service and excessive surcharges, but recently launched a marketing push to win over customers and has eased some of its fees or restrictions. It operates 31 airports in France, and Mr O’Leary said its Paris hub will continue to be Beauvais-Tilly, about 55 miles north of the French capital. He said acquiring slots at Charles de Gaulle or Paris Orly airports – which are hubs for Air France-KLM and their subsidiaries – presents an expensive challenge.","Chief executive Michael O'Leary made the vow to a French newspaper .

8ba5777dc7f6b5939f709a77f91fef2cda9e07d4,"Comcast is abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider, it was reported today. The move comes after Federal Communications Commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox. Bloomberg, followed by the New York Times, reported Thursday afternoon that Comcast is planning to 'walk away' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government. An announcement from the telecoms giant, already the biggest cable company in the country, could come as early as tomorrow. Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ding-dong: Experts, including Columbia University professor Tim Wu, declared the Comcast-Time Warner Cable murder dead after the FCC expressed skepticism . Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. Combining the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of TV and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof. That would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what Americans watch and download. That has had competitors, consumer groups, and Senators lining up to oppose the deal. Time Warner Cable's shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday - though Comcast stocks were actually up after the news . 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks. Al Franken, D-Minn., along with five other Democratic senators and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, this week urged the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices. Recent media reports suggested that regulators aren't going to approve it. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing unidentified people, said Department of Justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said, also citing unidentified people, said that FCC staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge, although no final decision had been made. The FCC would send the deal to a judge if it didn't believe it serves the public interest. The company has the right to present its case to the judge. But a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the FCC. 'It's a dead end for Comcast,' said Rob McDowell, a former FCC commissioner. The Justice Department declined to comment. The FCC declined to comment and spokesman Neil Grace said the review is ongoing. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met Wednesday with Justice Department and FCC officials. But she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal falls through, a transaction with Charter Communications Inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart. Charter's bid for Bright House Networks, which it announced in March, could also be killed. Many analysts expect that Charter, which lost out on its bid for Time Warner Cable to Comcast, to resurrect its effort if Comcast is rebuffed. 'Other cable deals that don't involve Comcast might be allowed to go through,' McDowell said. There 'seems to be an antipathy towards Comcast at the FCC' because the agency thinks Comcast didn't stick to the conditions of the NBCUniversal merger, he said. A combined Charter and Time Warner Cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million Internet customers. That's still smaller than Comcast alone, which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million Internet customers. Comcast wanted Time Warner Cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals Dish, DirecTV and Verizon's FiOS, as well as newer, cheaper online competitors like Netflix. The company had also said the deal would help it cut costs, including for programming — the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers. But Comcast may have to look overseas for future acquisitions. 'Washington's concern here is excessive control of broadband in the hands of a single company,' wrote analyst Craig Moffett in a client email. 'For all intents and purposes, their M&A ambitions would be on ice in the U.S.' Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3052969/Reports-say-Comcast-plans-drop-45B-Time-Warner-Cable-bid.html#ixzz3YAkxSfYl Follow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook .","Merger would have given the new company control of 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30percent of the paid TV market .

6394f51b120ceb3da5e7b53dd5167fc4cf80b514,"The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, the corporation’s boss has admitted. Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted…that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new, digital ways. ‘[Those ways] aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,’ the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC’s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.","Figures show that while millions still tune in they listen for shorter bursts .

Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million. It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday: Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed .

His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content.

Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year.

Members of the community have expressed their horror, describing Nicholas and David as outgoing and lively neighbors. 'They were very good people. They got along with everybody.' close family friend Paul Meyer told WWL TV. 'I can't comprehend how someone could do this to a family like that.' Another friend said he was in the garage with Nicholas just minutes before the murder. Police believe 17-year-old Allen fired the fatal shots before running to the car and saying 'I just shot two people' to Degruy, who allegedly drove off, the New Orleans Advocate reported. Degruy has been charged with two counts of being an accessory  to first-degree murder and one count of vehicle burglary. Allen is being held on charges of fleeing police and two counts of first-degree murder. Weapon: Col John Fortunato of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office holds the heavy-duty gun which authorities believe was used to kill David, an oil company manager, and his son Nicholas after their party this week . A police report says the younger Pence had pointed out a suspicious white Toyota crawling through the street . Neighbor and friend Michael Soignet has described the agonizing moment Mrs Pence returned to the address, saying: 'She just gave me a strapping hug, and I choked up. She choked up. There were just no words.' Describing the victims to The New Orleans Advocate, she said: 'You'll never find anybody that's going to throw out a bad word on them, and if somebody does, they don't have their story right. 'This had to be a random act. It had to be.'","Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, 56, had friends round to celebrate a victorious football game on Wednesday in their rural New Orleans home .

2d4a9718592d8ab6a96ad11d6396196fa855767a,"A father whose 20-year-old daughter was found murdered in Iowa last year made a desperate plea from China for U.S. authorities to do more in tracking down her killer, six months after the girl's body was discovered. And police in Iowa seem to have now answered it, by issuing a warrant for the girl's boyfriend, according to reports. Tong Shao, a chemical engineering student at Iowa State University, went missing in September 2014. After a three week search, police found her body stuffed in the trunk of her Toyota Camry in Iowa City. Shao's boyfriend, Xiangnan Li, 23, was listed as a person of interest in the case and is believed to have been the last person to see her alive, however he bought a one-way ticket to China in the days after his girlfriend went missing and has disappeared, CNN reported. Wanted for murder: An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for , Xiangnan Li, 23 (right), the boyfriend of Tong Shaom 20 (left), a University of Iowa student found murdered in September after going missing . Li had transferred to Iowa from Rochester Institute of Technology to be closer to Tong. The two had meet studying English in Beijing in 2011. They had checked into a hotel room together on September 5, 2014. The pair had stayed at the same hotel three times before and the owner knew them. According to police records obtained by CNN, two days earlier Tong had accidentally called Li - or 'pocket dialed' him - and he stayed on the line for 30 minutes, overhearing a conversation. Tong was complaining about Li to a friend and said things that 'were not nice', the records noted. The owner of the hotel told investigators Li left the hotel either on the night of September 6 or the morning of September 7, which he said was unusual, because he usually had to tell the couple to leave after the checkout time of 11am. Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8. He landed September 10. Before Li left Iowa, a text from his phone was sent to one of Tong's roommates. 'This message was purportedly from (Tong) and read that Li had an emergency in China and was flying back there, that she was going to take a bus to Minnesota to visit friends, and she would return in about a week,' the police documents stated. On September 9, Karen Yang, a friend of Li's sent him a message asking how things were going with Tong. 'Fine for now,' he replied. Killed: Tong Shao, 20, was found dead in her Toyota Camry on September 26 at an apartment complex in southeast Iowa City. Police believe she had been in the car for three weeks . Disappeared: Police say Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8, less than two days after his girlfriend was last seen alive . Tong's roommate, Jean, filed a missing person report on September 18, when she couldn't contact her. Together her roommates reached out to Tong's friends in Minnesota via social media, however they had not heard from her. On September 26 were body was found in her car parked near a low income housing complex on the outskirts of Iowa City. Residents had reported a foul smell, and responding officers wore Hazmat suits while inspecting the car, KCCI 8 reported at the time. Tong was found in the trunk, where her body had been for about three weeks, and next to her was a 15-pound barbell. An autopsy showed Tong died of  asphyxiation and blunt force trauma. A towel from the hotel had been wrapped around her head, according to police records. Inside the car police found copies of Li's flight information. Scene: Investigators had to don Hazmat suits to inspect Tong's car. Her body is believed to have been in the trunk for three weeks before they found it . Investigation: Tong died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her body was wrapped in a towel, and next to it was a 15-pound barbell, police say . Stench: Investigators grimace at the smell emanating from Tong's car after finding it dumped in September . A search of their hotel room found 'splatters and drips of various dried liquids throughout the room and behind the headboards of the beds,' the records said, concluding that 'it is possible her death may have occurred in the hotel room'. Tong's father, Chunsheng Shao, told CNN he was informed by detectives last month that an arrest warrant had been issued for Li. Li is wanted for the first-degree murder of Tong Shao. Police would not confirm this, saying their investigations are ongoing. While it is the first break in the case since the discovery of Tong's body, Mr Shao says he wants more to be done in solving his daughter's murder. Mr Shao and his wife saved $100,000 to send their daughter to university, and believed Iowa would be a quiet, safe place for her. 'We've given all our love to our daughter'"" Mr Shao said. 'I feel my life is meaningless after losing her.' Tragic: Tong, a junior chemical engineering student from China, was last seen in Ames more than three weeks before her body was discovered . While the U.S. has strong ties with China, there is no extradition treaty between the two. Legal experts say the most likely outcome is that China would prosecute people within China for crimes committed elsewhere. For Mr Shao, more needs to be done. 'We now plead with you, the U.S. authorities ...  share the evidence you have gathered with the Chinese authorities,' he said. 'This honorable act could very well save the life of other innocent and vulnerable victims, and will most assuredly allow the soul of our precious daughter to be comforted and rest in peace.'","Tong Shao, 20, was an international student from China attending Iowa State University .

540c63f91feef5b273e9b5ae37af1a1b49fedd5e,"Rocker Richie Sambora is being investigated by police over claims he 'threatened to kill' his former fashion designer lover. The ex Bon Jovi guitarist, 55, allegedly told former business partner Nikki Lund he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her', Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. Sambora is said to have made the chilling threat during a blazing telephone argument on March 19. His shaken former flame decided to report the allegation to authorities a week later. Police in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a 'person of interest' in an active investigation into criminal threats. Scroll down for video . Everything was rosy between the ex Bon Jovi guitarist and his lover and business partner Nikki Lund last July. But Lund has claimed in a statement to police that Sambora recently threatened her saying he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her,' Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. The rock star is believed to be on vacation in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and daughter Ava but faces questioning when he returns. Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks. 'The threat happened in the midst of Nikki launching her solo line. Richie apparently went mad on the phone at her and threatened to kill her. 'He said words to the effect that he was going to dig a hole in the desert and bury her.' Nikki, a close childhood friend of Kim Kardashian, filed a report Wednesday night with detectives from the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. Back to back: The couple posed for the cover of the new edition of  LA Fashion Magazine before they went their separate ways . 'She held off going to cops hoping that the situation would resolve itself,' added the source. But after advice from lawyers and business associates she made the report. 'Richie has been drinking heavily for months and acting erratically . 'He has threatened violence in the past.' Nikki and Kim K are friends from way back . Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava . They are said to have carried on seeing each other despite Sambora going on to date another Hollywood beauty, Denise Richards. The long-time fling became public last December when Lund was doing publicity for the new fashion line. The curvy blonde confessed to Playboy TV: 'He's amazing in bed ... how could you stay away from the guy?' Their joint venture collapsed at the last moment, however, despite the pair appearing on billboards together and on the cover of Los Angeles Fashion magazine. Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference. Lund's attorney declined to comment on the complaint.

a587bd4ad3b944a599468d9afb5c2ec54ae10994,"Fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives has reignited reports that missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have crashed  over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, ""I saw this strange plane"". This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said. The Maldvies National Defence Force released a statement in March last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance, which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities. A local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast, and that the plane was travelling so low it's doors could be seen. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,' an eyewitness told the website. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Over the past year, the search for the missing plane by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, headed by Australia, has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. The location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded 'pings' or 'electronic handshakes' sent between MH370 and a satellite for the final hours of it's journey. The flight made a number of unexplained deviations, and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with Air Traffic Control while flying between Malaysia and Vietnam. As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman. Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident . Dr Alec Duncan (left) from Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8 . The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations’ Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight . Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members . Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014 . 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing.

94a2086707cf79ca326d032dad1e3570f9e2b38a,"A clean-water advocate took an Earth Day swim in New York City's polluted Gowanus Canal, a site designated by the federal government as especially polluted, but quit less than halfway through. Christopher Swain wore a protective yellow suit as he went over a railing and into the water around 2pm Wednesday in Brooklyn but completed only two-thirds of a mile of the 1.8-mile waterway. He swam about an hour into the canal in  a stunt to urge environmental clean up that ultimately succumbed to the water's pollution because the experience was like 'swimming 'in a dirty diaper'. Christopher Swain, a clean-water activist, embarked on a 1.8-mile swim in the toxic Gowanus Canal, which has been designated as especially polluted by the Environmental Protection Agency, to urge its cleanup . The swimmer, who quit two-thirds of a mile into the swim, gargled hydrogen peroxide periodically to prevent contaminated water from getting down his throat . Swain, who has previously swam the Hudson and Columbia Rivers, said that cleanup of the Gowanus Canal, which was labelled as a Superfund site by the EPA, should be accelerated . 'It's probably the safest move at this point,' he said, according to Reuters, but pledged to swim the whole canal one day. 'I want to make it clear, no one is telling me to stop,' Swain continued, and said that impending bad weather played a role in his decision. The activist said 'It's not safe to swim in there,' according to Gothamist. He said that the water tasted 'Like mud, poop, ground-up grass, detergent and gasoline'. The 19th-century canal was once a major transportation route, but it's now so polluted with industrial and sewer discharges that it must, by law, be cleaned up. The federal Environmental Protection Agency says contaminates include PCBs, which were banned in the US in 1979. It warned Swain against taking the swim, posting a message on its Twitter account saying that it 'strongly advises AGAINST swimming' in the strip of water. The agency issued guidelines in 2011 saying that people should 'never swim in the canal', which runs over 1½ miles through a narrow industrial zone near increasingly wealthy neighborhoods in Brooklyn. It urged anyone who came in contact with the water to seek medical attention immediately if they felt sick. Crowds gathered on bridges along the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn as Swain was accompanied by a woman in a red kayak . The activist has previously swam the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia River in Washington to bring attention to water issues . Swain waves to the crowds who came to see him swim but were disappointed when he only made it two-thirds of a mile. A baby whale once got lost in the canal in 2007 and died within two days . After heavy rainstorms excess water from the sewer system flows in the canal, where  raw sewage and human excrement that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. An estimated 377million gallons of diluted raw sewage pour into the canal each year. 'There's a lot of poop in there,' Swain said after his swim, according to the New York Post. Dissolved arsenic in the water is thought to be at a level 60 times higher than that harmful to human health. A baby whale became lost in the canal in 2007 and was nicknamed Sludgie by locals. It died in two days. After rainstorms it can often be found with raw sewage that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. However Swain, who has previously done long swims along the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia in Washington, wanted to call attention to the slow clean up of the canal and urge for it to be accelerated. An estimated 377million gallons of sewage is poured into the Gowanus Canal every year. Above, trash pollutes the Brooklyn inlet in 2013 . The pollution in the Gowanus Canal combines decades of industrial dumping and general trash. It is particularly filthy after rainstorms . He gargled hydrogen peroxide to fight against any bacteria entering his body and had charcoal tablet to take that will help if he did, according to CityLab. Swain told reporters after he got out that he did not swallow any water. He was accompanied by a woman in a kayak, paddling a few feet away from him before he called it quits. Swain posted on Twitter that swimming in the canal is his 'federal right' under the Clean Water Act of 1972. Gowanus was labeled a Superfund site in 2010, with the EPA later saying that cleaning it up would take up to ten years and $506million, according to DNA Info. Costs will mostly fall on the city and companies that used to be along the canal such as National Grid. The agency plans on beginning dredging in the canal in 2017, which involves cleaning out 600,000 cubic yards of contaminated mud. Before Wednesday's failed effort, Swain also planned on swimming other polluted waters, such as the Bronx River and Newtown Creek, which runs between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. He said he has hope that New York's polluted waterways will one day be clean enough for swimmers without protective suits. The water advocate claims that it is his 'federal right' to swim in the canal under the Clean Water Act of 1972 .

5e0979d37ac3fecaa87fa7ecbafb2ec91b74a6b8,"You might think that you’re saving yourself some smart dollars by opting for the cheaper alternatives of everyday household items sold at two dollar stores but an environmental specialist has warned that you could actually be making your family sick. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children’s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases. A recent study of four major discount retailers  in the United States by the Ecology Centre found that 133 out of 164 products tested, including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws, contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern'. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children’s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases (stock picture) Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies, Nicole Bijlsma, told Daily Mail Australia that an investigation into products sold at Australian two dollar stores could produce similar results. Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies Nicole Bijlsma said the chemicals in these products are easily absorbed through ingestion and skin . 'Based on the amount of products that have been recalled over the years and studies which have found the levels of industrial chemicals are rising in younger generations, there's definitely a history to indicate that they [products at discount stores] could contain chemicals that cause adverse health affect,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'It depends on the type of chemical, but a lot of these things are absorbed through ingestion and dermal exposure. Kids have a very high hand to mouth ratio and are putting things in their mouth all the time.' A set of children's necklaces examined by the study were found to have high levels of bromine, chlorine and lead. Bromine is known to permanently affect developing brains and present reproduction problems in those exposed to it, while studies have found that chlorine causes cancer as well as thyroid and kidney disease. Meanwhile, scientists have found that even the smallest amount of lead can affect a child's ability to learn. Dozens of other products were also listed as having harmful chemicals, including silly straws which were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates which have been linked to birth defects, reduced fertility, cancer, learning disabilities, diabetes, and other health issues, according to the report. She said that a recent study of four major discount retailers in the United States, which found 133 out of 164 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern', would find similar results in Australia . Additional harmful substances found in the products included polyvinyl chloride plastic (also known as PVC or vinyl) and packaging chemical bisphenol-A (also known as BPA). 1. Buy Australian made products: They are subject to rigorous regulations and Australian manufactures are not permitted to use harmful chemicals. 2. Go back to basics: Use glass and stainless steel to store food instead of plastics. 3. Less is best: If it’s not edible, it won’t be good for your skin either, as it absorbs whatever is put on it. 4. Try the natural approach against pests first: Instead of pest sprays, install fly screens and ensure no food is around before reaching for chemicals. 5. Leave your shoes outside: take them off before you go inside and trek dust and pesticides from outside into your home . Ms Bijlsma, a building biologist, who assess people's homes - including measuring chemicals in their water, air, building materials and household products - to see what's making them sick, said that while discount stores were the focus of negative attention, harmful chemicals can be found in any product which is manufactured outside of Australia. 'About 90 per cent or more of our products, including footwear, clothing and furnishings, aren't actually manufactured in Australia. They're manufactured in Asia and imported products are not regulated in the same way as they are here and that's where the problem lies,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'To use a safer alternative would cost more money and sometimes it's just easier for company's not to bother doing research - why would they? In Australia they don't have to prove that the chemicals they are using are not harmful. 'BPA is a good example because people got wind that it was affecting children's behaviour and had an increased risk of breast cancer - so the manufacturer changed it and replaced it with bisphenol-S which has shown to be worse. A non-slip bath tub mat was found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) 'It's about generating profits for industry and so they get cheap products in, but they neglect safety standards. 'It's possible because regulators don't ask for a certificate of analysis to prove there are no banned industrial chemicals  in the product and just assume that what the manufacturer overseas says is accurate.' A spokesman for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Daily Mail Australia that while 'there is always a possibility that some products on the market might not meet accepted standards of safety' the 'chance is very small'. It assured that the ACCC had an active chemical inspection program and that the products supplied to discount variety stores are 'often included in analytical surveys and surveillance activities conducted by the ACCC' and other product safety regulators. However they also put great emphasis on Australian Consumer Laws which require suppliers to 'ensure their products are safe and suitable for their intended purpose', saying: 'most suppliers have systems in place to source safe products.' Stock image: Children's stick-on earnings sold at the stores were found to contain high levels of bromine and chlorine and medium levels of tin . Latex coated gloves were found to have high levels of chlorine and medium levels of antimony while silly straws were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) Ms Bijlsma said not enough was being done by the ACCC, which she said only completes occasional spot checks, with thousands of shipping containers going unchecked. 'The system is based on just doing spot checks here and there, but it doesn't happen with every product,' she said. 'We have a mismatch of five or six organisations in Australia that are involved in chemical and manufacturing regulation and they are under-resourced, understaffed and it takes them years to regulate a chemical. 'The way chemicals are regulated here is primarily through self-regulation: it's based on a reactive approach system where if you have had a significant health complaint from a consumer, you are obliged to pass it on. 'Then they [regulators] list it as a ""priority chemical"", see what other countries do and talk to other organisations, and write a recommendation report - this takes years. Extensions chords were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates while plastic spoons were found to have low levels of chlorine and tin (stock pictures) 'That's not adequate to protect our families' safety. It's not good enough. The system needs to change and the burden of proof needs to be on the manufacturer to prove the product is safe before it's released on the market.' The ACCC stated that products found to be unsafe are removed from the market or recalled by suppliers and that any company that fails to comply with standards faces a fine of up to $1.1 million. But part of the problem lies in the average Australian's trust that anything being sold to them on a supermarket shelf is tested, according to Ms Bijlsma.

Alice Barker snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen. Barker had danced at legendary clubs like the Apollo, Cotton Club and Zanzibar Club, and had appeared in movies commercials and television shows. This is the moment 102-year-old Alice Barker, who used to dance with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, got to see herself shimmy and shake on film for the first time . Barker (pictured far right in the video) snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen . But she had never gotten the chance to watch herself dance. She didn't even have any photographs or memorabilia to remember her years on stage. It was David Shuff, who met Barker years ago when he brought his therapy dog to her retirement home, that finally reunited the one-time famous dancer with her videos. After a long and unsuccessful first search, Shuff connected with Mark Cantor, a collector of short musical films called 'soundies' who runs the online archive Jazz on Film. It was then Shuff and Cantor discovered that Barker's videos were filed under 'Baker', a misspelling of her name - which was why no one had been able to find them before, according to Mashable. They located three of Barker's soundies, giving her the chance to finally watch her days in the chorus line, where she was almost always in the front row. 'Don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing,' Barker sang along as she watched one of her routines. When Shuff asked her how many years she danced, Barker replied 'that's all I ever did, that was it!' She said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again'.

Her mother had gone to the house to retrieve something when a young Barker heard a band play nearby. 'When she came back I was gone,' said Barker. 'I was down there naked just going, dancing.' 'And then, if the band would stop playing, I'd look at them and ""come on, let's get it going, let's get it going here.""' Barker said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again' But the most special part for Barker was getting to watch herself dance again. 'I used to often say to myself, I am being paid to do something that I enjoy doing and I would do it for free,' she said . Shuff shared Barker's story on Reddit, where he wrote that the videos were now in her possession and that they are often played in her retirement center's communal room, noting that she's a 'rock star these days'.

43714dad35c2ec64d16ef6bdd17853a2f5eb0744,"A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight. Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat’s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning ‘strange wing’, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning ""strange wing"" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don’t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how  the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: ‘As for gliding, if Yi qi’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. ‘But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. ‘That is clearly the case in the authors’ reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. ‘Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. ‘And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.’","Yi qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late Jurassic .

Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. Amanda Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, and Murphy's sister, Ashley Murphy, cry after speaking about the moment they learned of the accident that killed Murphy, her unborn child, and her fiancee, Jason Timmons, during Robert Dellinger's sentencing  on Wednesday . Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons. The former Fortune 500 executive has admitted causing a highway crash that killed them and their unborn fetus . 'I have been robbed and violated. I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing, the newspaper reported. 'You have my deepest, most heartfelt apology, condolences and remorse for your loss. I am so sorry,' the 54-year-old Dellinger said through sobs. 'My guilt and remorse will be with me forever. I ask for your forgiveness, and I pray for your healing.' Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was a senior vice president and chief financial officer at PPG Industries Inc. when he left in 2011 because of health problems. He also held high-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co. Earlier he had  told the court he has 'never been suicidal.' Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . He pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide for the deaths of the couple, who were from Wilder, Vermont, and to assault for the death of the fetus. He faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes on Thursday. During Wednesday's hearing, Dellinger's wife, Deborah, called him a man of 'ethics, integrity and friendship,' the Valley News reported. 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones,' she said as her husband broke down at the defense table. 'We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Defense lawyers have said Dellinger was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. In asking for a shorter sentence, they also contend he was suffering from withdrawal of a sleeping aid. Robert Dellinger thanks his family and friends for their support in court on Wednesday. He told a judge that he wasn't suicidal at the time of the crash . Attorney Steven Gordon wrote in a sentencing brief they now know 'a medical event' was the main cause 'of this accident.' Dellinger has been jailed since his arrest in December. His lawyers want a sentence that would see him serve only about eight months in prison after being given credit for time already served. Investigators say Dellinger told them that on the day of the accident he 'had a disagreement with his wife and went to Vermont to drive around. He said he was very depressed and gloomy and wanted to have a car wreck and kill himself.' On Wednesday, Dellinger told the court: 'I have never been suicidal.' Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said in court that Dellinger's truck reached 101 mph in the seconds before the crash and was going 87 mph one second before he hit the SUV. His truck sheared off the top of the SUV. The medical examiner's report compared the injuries suffered by Murphy and Timmons to those of plane crash victims. Dellinger suffered cuts and bruises. Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median in December 2013 . According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R.

Helicopter cameras caught a swarm of cops kicking and punching 30-year-old Francis Pusok more than 80 times on Thursday, after he fled his southern California home when they tried to arrest him for identity theft charges. In an interview with NBC 4 on Monday,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear 'This isn't over'. Scroll down for video . Scarring experience: Francis Pusok (left) spoke for the first time on Monday, four days after he was beaten up by cops in footage taken from a helicopter. His girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, pictured center . When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house on Thursday, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. On the run: Pusok fled his house in San Bernardino County on Thursday after Sheriff's deputies showed up to arrest him on identity theft charges. He led police on a more than two-hour long chase, part of it on horseback . On the ground: At the end of the chase, police officers shot Pusok with a taser and he fell to the ground. Pusok claims they handcuffed him within 15 seconds and then continued to beat him despite the fact he was lying helpless on the ground . Cruel: The helicopter continued to record the first two cops beating Pusok up as more deputies swooped in . Under investigation: In the aftermath of the disturbing video, 10 officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated . Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, ""When is it going to stop?""' Bruised: Pusok sports a painful black eye in his booking photo. He was released from jail on Sunday . After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident have been placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. Deputies have been called to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. Disturbing: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon says he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that he has launched an internal investigation . However, Pusok's pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are 'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.' She also said that Pusok, father of their three children, was arrested in 2002 for driving at unsafe speed on a sidewalk but that he was only riding a bicycle at the time. What concerns Bindner the most though was the one deputy's alleged whispered threat of 'This isn't over' at the end of the beating. 'That concerns me because we have children together and I don't want any kind of retaliation against me or my children,' she said. Doing better: After visiting her longtime partner in jail on Sunday, Pusok's girlfriend Jolene Bindner said he was on the road to recovery . Threats: The couple share three children together and have another on the way. Bindner (left) says she is concerned about a deputy who whispered 'This is not over' to her boyfriend at the end of the beating . Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell said his client's criminal history has nothing to do with any possible excessive force case. 'If it wasn't for that helicopter and the camera...they would be charging him with 10 counts of battering a police officer,' Terrell said. 'That's how it rolls here, that's what goes on every single day.' Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.","Francis Pusok, 30, was arrested Thursday after a hours long chase with police in San Bernardino County, California .

d11ecbcc828403caa6d356def04c77b373de4459,"The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has denied that partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities. Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor. 'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu.

The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'. America's sanctions on Iran relating to 'terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles' will remain in place.","Senator Bob Corker has countered Barack Obama's previous assertion .

The other, five decades on, pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair. These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Fredric Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High, Irvington, New Jersey. They were taken at the age of 18, when he was, in his own words, just ‘a Jewish kid from Newark,’ and before he had transformed himself, in every sense, into the figure lampooned on Netflix show ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,’ with such devastating consequences. Scroll down for video . The way he was: These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Frederic Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High in New Jersey . Dispirited: The famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. He had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Changes: Five decades after his high school photo with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair, Dr. Brandt was pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair . It is two days since the famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. The City of Miami Police confirmed the suicide after Daily Mail Online broke the news earlier, and, according to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show. Now, seen here for the first time, Dr Brandt’s High School photos provide a glimpse into his life before fame, fortune and fillers. The pictures, taken in 1967, show a hint of the smile that, according to the school’s yearbook earned him a reputation for his ‘infectious grin’ and saw him characterized by his sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.’ Born Frederic Sheldon Brandt in 1949, he was prolific in his High School achievements, posing in one photo alongside other award-winning students. Among his many accolades listed are Assistant Editor of High School magazine the Morellian, President of the Spanish Club, Vice President of the Debate Club, Vice President of the Political Science Club and a place on the National Honors Society. He was also an enthusiastic member of the Theatre Arts Society and Tennis team. He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student. But, for all that, in one of his last interviews, given to the New York Times in March 2014, he recalled feeling very much that he was ‘more of a different child,’ as he grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. He said: ‘I remember taking things apart as a kid, radios and other things. I was always questioning everything to see how it worked.’ In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth – he had hundreds of patients, saw as many as 30 daily with some paying as much as $7,000 a pop and had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store. Three years before he graduated and before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly. Loss: Three years before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly . Dr. Brandt was known for his ‘infectious grin’ and characterized by classmates as having a sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.' He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student . The awards and accolades followed him from this 1967 yearbook through his professional career . Speaking to the New York Times last March he admitted: ‘It was a lot to process, but you just have to forge ahead.’ He certainly did. Immediately after high school he attended Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He went on to graduate with his MD from Drexel University’s Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1975. Dermatology was not his first love though it would be the speciality on which he settled and which earned him a client list including Madonna, Kelly Ripa, Stephanie Seymour and a constellation of other entertainment big hitters. As a student he loved oncology, nephrology, hematology and cardiology. The one area of medicine in which the life-long bachelor took no real pleasure was pediatrics. He explained: ‘You spent all your time calming patients down.’ Between 1976 and 1978 he completed his internship at New York University Veterans Administration before going onto specialise in dermatology at the University of Miami, 1978–1981. He set up a private practice in Miami and it was only in 1998 that an invitation to use a colleague’s New York office once a month to treat patients with ever evolving newly introduced facial fillers led Dr Brandt to his ultimate area of expertise.

Hurtful parody: According to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Tina Fey takes a selfie with Maya Rudolph and  Martin Short last February. Poignantly, given his own unhappy demise, Dr Brandt’s ambition in his work had always been, he said, ‘to restore a face to harmony,’ and ‘to keep people working and feeling vital and good about themselves.’ He built an empire on his work. As well as seeing his private patients, he hosted a weekly call-in show on Sirius XM radio, ran a company manufacturing his own line of skin creams and serums and appeared regularly on the speaking circuit proselytizing on his speciality at international medical conferences. Over the years Dr Brandt practiced what he preached. He became best known for his Y lifts in which fillers are injected below the cheekbones. And he regularly injected himself with Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvedem and Voluma leading to his own startlingly changed appearance - converted into cruel and undeniable parody on ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’ as Dr Franff. The good life: In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth. He had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store . Played by Martin Short Franff’s transformation is so grotesque that he can barely utter certain words – including his own name. He is actually called Grant, rendering the veil of fiction between the character and Brandt even more gossamer thin. At one point the character is seen drinking from a surgical bag and reinflating his face after being punched. For Dr Brandt, who had always prided himself on being ‘a kind of pioneer in pushing the limits to see how things work and what the look would be,’ the humor, viewed through the prism of his depression, cut deep. There have been many tributes since his death Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, yesterday tweeted, ‘Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.’ Morning show host, Kelly Ripa, posted: ‘My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr Frederic Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer.’","Photos obtained by Daily Mail Online show surgeon to the stars Dr Brandt, who hanged himself in Miami on Sunday, the year he graduated from his New Jersey high school .

A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet . Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above . She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own.

Robert Mccombs told a court in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Wednesday that Steven Carl Day admitted to him and his roommate Roger Musick that he molested a young relative and that he was molesting other young girls. 'Day said he thought one of the girls was starting to like it,' Mccombs testified. Witnessed the confession: Robert Mccombs (left) said that when Steven Carl Day admitted to him and his roommate Roger Musick (right) that he was a child molester, Musick strangled him to death . Shocking revelation: Steven Carl Day was allegedly murdered on December 18, 2013 after he told two friends that he molested young girls and that he thought, 'one of them was starting to like it' Day met up with Musick and Mccombs at a bar on December 18 to have drinks for Mccombs' birthday and that's where the shocking confession allegedly took place. 'My jaw just dropped that he would just admit it, blurt it out like that. I looked over at Roger and he was just as shocked as I was.' Musick, 39, mouthed the words 'I want to kill him,' Mccombs told the court. Mccombs told the court that the next thing he knew, Mccombs was attacking Day. Mccombs describes seeing Musick holding Day in a choke hold on the floor. 'When I saw him in the choke-hold, his arms were down, his eyes were bulging. He wasn't moving,' Mccombs told the court. The Detroit Free Press reports that the roommates put Day's dead body into the back of Mccombs' van and headed north where they found a ridge to drop the body. Addiction: After the murder in 2013, friends of Day said he was an Army veteran who had struggled in recent years while battling an alcohol addiction . Mccombs said that the two had breakfast before parting ways. Musick went to work and Mccombs went to their home to get rid of Day's belongings. He claims that he put Day's backpack and coat in a trash can at a nearby shopping center and then rode Day's bike to an abandoned car wash near the home. When detectives found Day's hat and cell phone in Mccomb's van, both he and Musick were charged with murder. Days later the charges were dropped but they were both later arrested and charged with tampering with evidence. Open container: This mug shot of Steven Carl Day, who described by friends as an alcoholic, was taken in 2011 after he was charged with consuming alcohol in public . Mccomb's was released from jail in Early March after more than a year behind bars for the 'tampering with evidence' charge. Musick was also about to be released but police later found there was enough evidence to charge him with Day's murder. Musick was returned to the Kent County Jail without bond. Kent County Sheriff's Detective Martin Albert said he found evidence at Day's home after the 2013 murder that suggested he he had admitted to molesting a five-year-old relative, 35 years ago. At the time of his death, Day had never been charged or prosecuted for any molestation crime. Though, Day was taking part in the Salvation Army's 12-step 'Turning Point' program during which Day confessed in a letter to the molestation. The program is intended to help participants confront their demons, particularly with addictions. Detective Albert testified after the murder that Day's sister was helping with the murder investigation and  told him her brother had admitted the molestation of a five-year-old relative about 35 years ago. A detective who analyzed the cell phones of both Mr Musick and Mr McCombs told Michigan's M LIve text messages had been sent between the two the day the body was found. McCombs allegedly wrote: 'You OK? The world is a better place today and one little girl can sleep tonight because her monster is gone.'

7d9b131840d3a7526ff744eb4795b5bd2ea35f40,"A man, 21, allegedly forced a tearful 15-year-old girl into his car on Saturday and screamed, 'you will never see your parents again!' in attempt to force her to be his teen bride. Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment. The Star Tribune reports that the girl's family reported the kidnapping on Sunday and that they opposed to their daughter marrying Xiong, whom she was dating, because of their age differences. Alleged kidnapper: Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St.Paul, Minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15-year-old girlfriend to be his traditional Hmong bride . Xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and Xiong to marry in the Hmong tradition. The girl, who has not been identified because she is a minor, told police that Xiong was her 'boyfriend' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on Saturday night. Xiong allegedly threw the girl's iPad against a wall at her family's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car. Her parents were not home at the time. The girl told police that she managed to escape but that Xiong took hold of her a second time, forced her into his car, and took her to his family's home. When the girl's parents returned home from work at around noon on Sunday, they learned of the kidnapping from their oldest son. The girl's parents called Xiong's parents and demanded that they give them their daughter back. The girl's older brother later drove to the Xiong's home where they willingly let the girl go home. The girl told police that she and Xiong had been 'dating' in January and first had sex when she was just 14-years-old. The victim's father told police that Xiong asked him to marry his daughter on multiple occasions but that he said no because of their large age difference. Xiong admitted to kidnapping the girl and said that she tried to escape from him on Highway 26. This is not Xiong's first brush with the law. In 2009 Xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl when he was 15. He pleaded guilty. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said about the case, 'This is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15-year-old girl that cannot be tolerated in our community. 'Women and girls are not property, they are human beings who have every right to be free from violence and to live according to how they choose for themselves. 'We allege that the defendant has sexually exploited a minor who cannot legally consent to sex, and has taken violent actions to kidnap and hold the victim against her will.' According to Hmongculture.net, the Hmong are an ethnic group that come from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. In the late 1980s many Hmong people came to the United States after being sponsored by the Lutheran church. The majority relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota and Fresno, California. In traditional Hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl's family to wed her. If that method fails, there is a tradition of 'bride-napping' in Hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home. If the girl does not accept a gift from her sometimes forceful suitor then she may go back to her family, says Ahmongwoman.com .","Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment .

'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, ""you're fat, you're ugly"", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said ""it was just a rash"". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how ""I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her"". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.'

Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin. The man's 22-year-old girlfriend, Rachael Sheppard, told the NT News he had just gestured at the family by waving with his little pinky as people do in Darwin.

d65cb29b3a3484836928db5cfa40d1be009e11be,"A man who launched an online campaign to help him destroy his brand new $49,000 Jeep will read out a 'not sorry' apology to the company on national television tonight. In June last year,  Ashton Wood raised $18,000 online so he and 300 people could destroy his car after Jeep refused to pay a full refund for the car or replace the vehicle which he claimed had suffered 21 separate mechanical problems. During a failed settlement between the manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Jeep, and Mr Wood, one of the requests made by the car company was for the disgruntled buyer to publish an 'apology' in a national publication. However, because no one would publish the apology, he will instead read it out on the ABC's 'The Checkout' tonight. Scroll down for video . Ashton Wood issued this apology to Jeep after the car company requested he apologise for criticising them . The Queenslander launched a public campaign last year asking others to help him destroy his car in protest . Compiled by Mr Wood and the ABC's The Checkout, the apology reads: 'My personal apology to Jeep: I'm Sorry. 'Dear Jeep, I'm sorry. I'm sorry my Jeep broke down before it even left the dealership. 'I'm sorry it had 21 problems. I'm sorry it had to be towed four times. I'm sorry I wasn't more grateful for your offer of a new battery. 'I'm sorry you wouldn't offer me a replacement or refund. But most of all, I'm sorry I bought a Jeep.' Mr Wood launched a Kickstarter campaign last year in an effort to raise $22,500 - the amount Chrysler offered him to buyback the car - and allow donors the chance to be involved in the car's destruction. He is now campaigning for the United State's Lemon laws to be introduced in Australia. Pictured: 'lemon car' drivers protest against vehicle companies who refuse to refund or replace their cars . Mr Wood's extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems . The extreme measures came after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010, had numerous problems including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking. He claims years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his car, which he bought from a Sunshine Coast dealer in Queensland had proved fruitless. Despite successfully destroying his vehicle, Mr Wood - who could not afford to challenge the international car company in court - has refused to back down. Along with a number of consumer led organsiations Mr Wood is campaigning for the United States' Lemon Laws to be introduced in Australia. These included the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking . He said that Lemon Laws state 'that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked' 'Lemon is the old term which was used to mean a really bad car. In the U.S. they have had the Lemon Law's in place for about 35 years, we don't have it,' Mr Wood told Daily Mail Australia. 'They differ from state to state but in Kansas, where they have the most strict version, is states that if there's three major issues with car or a number of minor issues or one safety issues then it needs to be replaced or refunded with no questions asked. 'It's a lot clearer than Australian consumer laws which just says that the product should be fit for purpose and the dealer should do the right thing. 'I'm not done yet. I want to keep the pressure up until the government sits up and takes some responsibility and reviews this law.' Consumer laws have somewhat improved since Mr Wood's story came to the public's attention, by including a notion of 'major failure'. However, they still remain unclear about a car owner's rights when their vehicle has a number of smaller problems like Mr Wood's. After Mr Wood's car was destroyed, a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal . Along with Lemon Laws for Australia and Lemon Vehicles in Australia, Mr Wood has launched several petitions and staged a number of events campaigning for more specific laws that address the holes in the legislation. They have sent out Lemon Law stickers to hundreds of Australians with 'lemon cars' in order to 'put pressure on the government and show that the movement is gaining momentum'. A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner'. Mr Woods car was destroyed over four hours with the help of 300 people who wielded bats and sledgehammers and shot bow and arrows at it at a demolition derby last year. More than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it . A spokesperson for Jeep told Daily Mail Australia 'we never comment on individual cases except to say we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner' 'The car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof,' Mr Wood said. 'The whole car lifted two, maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire.' He said the 'Pièce de résistance' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot. 'The serious side to it is that I shouldn't have had to destroy a $50,000 car,' he said. 'If the law was there today and if Chrysler group respected and looked after its customers then it wouldn't have had to happen.' Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000. Despite knowing he could make $28,000 by selling it himself, he said felt uncomfortable with the option. Mr Wood's apology can be seen in full on Thursday night at 8pm on ABC's The Checkout.

4a04d822100c0a4b22d6a8f6e26ef159233662b6,"Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T. Despite his newest models being nearly 90 years old, the businessman, from Buckinghamshire, is selling one every week, including to the TV and film industry who have used then in shows such as Downton Abbey. Mr Tuckett says his customers love the Model T - the first affordable mass-produced car - because they don't require need road tax or an MOT and are cheaper to maintain than a modern car, with each one selling for  around £10,000. Scroll down for video . Toot: Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett (pictured) has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T . Top of the range: This 1914 model is £24,750 and is one of around one a week sold by the Buckinghamshire dealer . Yours for £13,500: this 1917 Model T is on the market and like all the classic cars they don't require road tax or a MOT . Back to basics: Some of the vehicles need to have their headlamps lit by match, left, and right are the rudimentary pedals for braking, accelerating and changing gear . But with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast and some of his pre-1915 model have gas headlights still lit by a match. Mr Tuckett, 58, has customers who use them as wedding cars and even one that is used as a hearse. He discovered his passion for the model when he got a call from his great uncle, John Brazil, asking him to accompany him on the London to Brighton commercial run - an event for historic commercial vehicles. He had a Model T van, previously used for transporting sausages and pies to London, and Neil had driven it once in a field before he got behind the wheel in Hyde Park for the event. He continued maintaining the vehicle afterwards and his great uncle left the van to him when he died. The agricultural engineer started his own business in 1984 but when the work dried up a few years later, his team turned their attention to Model Ts.. Now they struggle to keep up with the demand at his garage in North Marston, Buckinghamshire, and sell the cars for around £10,000 each. Neil has about six himself and goes touring in them with other fans of the car. MODEL T . Made . 1908-1927 . Price (from) £125 .

Wheelbase . 98"" Engine type . 1.6L . Horsepower . 120 . Steering . Power-assisted . MPG (Miles Per Gallon) 28 . Fuel tank capacity . 12.4 gallons . Weight . 2,578lbs . Neil said: 'We're a niche market specialist and I've got about 100 years of man experience of Model Ts with my team. 'We do about one a week, 50 a year. They're coming in here as fast as I can fix them. There's about 3,000 in the UK and we look after a good proportion of those. 'It was a very popular car. At one point, half the cars in the world were Model Ts. They're affordable, usable and repairable, even though they are 100 years old. 'It's more leisurely than a modern car. Its cruising speed is 30mph, at 40mph you're starting to rattle and to hit 45mph you'd have to be going downhill with the wind behind you. 'But it's cheaper to maintain than a modern car. The insurance costs about £50 a year, you don't need road tax or an MOT and there are no major expenses. Alternative forecourt: Business is booming at Neil Tuckett's time warp garage in the heart of rural Buckinghamshire . Meticulous: Mr Tuckett sources his Ford spares from all over the globe and carefully puts the machines back together again. Behind the wheel: The second-hand car dealer says that beauty of the Model is how simple and enjoyable it is to drive . Sales pitch: Mr Tuckett says: 'They're like a giant meccano set really, and so beautifully simple and reliable they just won't let you down. You also don't require road tax or and MOT' 'There's probably 20 companies in the world making new parts for the Model T and about 80 per cent of Model Ts are new parts now, but they don't make new chassis. 'The main source of original parts is America, 14million were built there. The parts are all affordable and there's no electrics so little to go wrong. 'And everyone seems to remember them, they know what a Model T is. That's quite surprising after 100 years, it's an iconic car. 'They're lots of fun. I'm about to go to Scotland with a Model T4 group - there's ten of us touring for a week in the Outer Hebrides. 'I've seen a lot of the UK that I would never have seen if I wasn't driving an old car.' Thing of beauty: The Model T is an icon, but with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast . Germans may have invented the petrol engine, but it was Henry Ford, a Michigan-Irish farmer used his genius to realise its social potential. Ford said he had to invent his ‘gasoline buggy’ to escape the crushing boredom of his own life on the farm in the United States. The Model T was made from 1908 to 1927 and is generally regarded as the first affordable car. In total more than 15million were made. The first Model Ts were fairly expensive, about £500. But by the early 1920s, when millions were being produced, the price had dropped to about £125, which was roughly equivalent to the average annual wage. Ford was obsessed with efficiency: his production lines were inspired by the meat-packing yards of Chicago and it became the first mass produced car in the United states . His famous decree that customers could choose ‘any colour so long as it is black’ was not to limit consumer choice, but to reduce costs. In Ford’s day, freshly painted cars were left in the sun to dry. Black dried more quickly and was thus cheaper. By 1914, a Model T could be manufactured in 93 minutes and spare parts were all available through the Sears Roebuck mail-order catalogue for drivers to install themselves.","Neil Tuckett's  newest model on his forecourt is  90 years old - but he is still selling one Model T every week .

The mother-of-four had her first experience of depression as a child and has suffered attacks throughout her adult life. Things were so difficult at one point that she planned to crash her car into a brick wall. And in an interview with The Telegraph on Saturday the 57-year-old revealed how close she came to suicide one day after her divorce from first husband Clive Jones. Scroll down for video . Presenter Fern Britton, who suffers from depression, has revealed how close she came to suicide following her divorce from first husband Clive Jones . The presenter and author, who has been married to her second husband TV chef Phil Vickery, 53, for fifteen years, claims she knew the marriage was never right, but remembers the time after the divorce being particularly bleak. Fern, who had three children with  Clive, twins Harry and Jack, 21, and Grace, 18, and has another daughter, Winifred, 13, with Phil, said: 'I remember very clearly, when they were all little and sitting around the table, all shiny-faced and having their supper, and I'd think: ""Right, you've got everything you want. Lovely! Now I'm just going to pop upstairs and kill myself."" ' Meeting Phil whilst working on Ready, Steady, Cook was something of a salvation for the blonde, who finally came off anti-depressants last year but admits she is fully expecting to go back on them when she has another episode. Fern and husband Phil Vickery will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary next month . The couple met on the TV food show Ready, Steady, Cook . At least now she has learned to recognise the signs, telling Good Housekeeping this month: 'I haven’t had an episode for a long time. I’m cross that it’s been there and that it lurks around, but I’ve started to understand it more. I reached a stage where I knew when it was coming, hurtling towards me, and I thought, don’t run away, just stand there, brace yourself, and let it happen. Because I knew it would pass. People who are going through their first or second episode don’t trust that it will pass – but it really will.' Today, as she promotes her sixth novel 'A Good Catch' Fern is happy, positive and looking forward to a bright - and Botox-free - future. Phil, 53, and Fern, 57, have four children between them . The author has declared that she has no interest in cosmetic surgery, deciding instead to grow older gracefully . She has declared that she has no interest in cosmetic surgery, deciding instead to grow older gracefully, telling Bryony Gordon: 'I know I'm never going to look the way I did when I was 25, but I know I could look very odd.

I'm not going to get Botox or have things done. I'm going to show my children that this is what humans do: we get older.' The keen cyclist, who starts a three-week cycle from John O'Groats to Land's End to raise money for Genesis Research Trust next week, insists that being fit is more important to her than looking younger, saying: 'My bosoms are dropping? Blah, that's life! I am vain about being as fit as I can be – not about my wrinkles. I’ve had that conversation with myself about, should I do Botox, should I do this, should I do that – and I’ve talked myself out of it. I’d prefer to be the woman I should be.

7892de5301f89e1c1ef1566c07cce7f135362337,"A second spectacular blast from the Calbuco volcano in southern Chile has covered nearby towns and villages in a thick layer of ash. The first eruption in over four decades yesterday sent vast clouds of dust more than six miles into the air, creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region today heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told MailOnline it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is one of the most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes but was not under any special observation before it suddenly sprung into life at around 6pm local time yesterday. Emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert. Scroll down for video . Ghost town: Most people have abandoned the La Ensenada locality in Puerto Varas (pictured) which has been caked in ash despite being over 18 miles away from the massive eruption at Calbuco volcano . Scared: A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas (pictured) said she saw 'the column of smoke rising up' from the volcano when she looked out of her window' Aftermath: The two violent explosions shot billions of cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere, caking nearby localities like La Ensenada in mounds of abrasive soot . Colossal: Two massive explosions from Calbuco volcano in southern Chile have shot up to ten billion cubic metres of ash over six miles into the atmosphere (pictured) Dangerous: Many people in Puerto Varas (pictured) have become worried about the damage the ash will cause to their health . Stuck: As tractors try to clear the mounds of ash that have blocked the roads, one local said: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared... We have a layer of smoke above us' Contaminated: Ash from the second blast seriously impared the visibility of drivers fleeing the city of La Ensenada (pictured) near the volcano . Isolated: A masked and hooded woman stands alone among the ash falling in the San Marin de Los Andes area near Calbuco . Evacuation: Thousands have fled their homes after Calbuco erupted unexpectedly on Wednesday and was still pouring ash into the sky on Thursday . Explosion: A second eruption from the Calbuco volcano in Chile (pictured) has forced over 4,000 people to abandoned their homes and covered nearby communities in ash . Dramatic: 4,000 people were evacuated from cities around Calbuco following a second spectacular and frightening eruption today (pictured) Eruption: Residents of Puerto Montt had a clear view of the first terrifying explosion yesterday (pictured) which threw ash and smoke a staggering six miles into the air . Spectacle: The dense ash cloud from Calbuco today created an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night sky . Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt - 620 miles south of the capital Santiago. Even Professor David Pyle who has studied over a century of eruptions across Chile's 1000-mile stretch of volcanoes ranks this one  among the strongest - and claims its ash could cross the Pacific to Australia. He ranked this particular explosion 'a three or four' on the Volcanic Explosivity Index which means it could unleash an astonishing ten billion cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere. Professor Pyle told MailOnline: 'Based on a 15km-high plume and an eruption of around an hour and a half, that’s quite strong. This particular volcano has erupted a number of times over the last hundred years. 'Sometimes it has lasted a day and other times it has bubbled on for a few weeks. The activity’s died down for the moment but we don’t know what’s going to happen next.' Many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas admitted many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' 'People went into a state of panic' as the ash cloud spread, according to Miguel Diaz who lives in Puerto Montt 14 miles away. He added: 'I heard a loud noise as if somebody had detonated an atomic bomb.' Abandoned: Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured since the first explosion yesterday . Volatile: Bachelet said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people . Covered: Resident of the Ensenada locality (pictured) near Calbuco struggled to clear the mountains of ash that had built up on their rooves . Locked out: Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano . Protection: Even residents in the Argentinian city of San Carlos de Bariloche (pictured) donned gas masks to avoid the respiratory damage caused by the ash from Calbuco . Deadly: Smoke and lava spew from the Calbuco volcano, as seen from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas which is over 18 miles away . 'Even small amounts of ash can be really quite disruptive,' according to Professor Pyle who added: 'It affects power supplies and it can be disruptive to agriculture. You don’t need particularly thick accumulations of ash to start to have physical consequences.' Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured and the only person who went missing since the first explosion was found on Thursday. She said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people. The director of a radio station in Puerto Montt described how hundreds of locals rushed to get gas following the eruption, forcing stations to ration their sales. And supermarkets closed their doors to avoid being looted. LATAM airlines has cancelled flights to and from Puerto Montt because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines. A volcano in the Caulle Cordon of southern Chile erupted violently in 2011, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the evacuation of more than 3,500 people. Stiff winds blew the ash from that explosion over the border to Argentina where the thick, abrasive soot coated slopes in the sky resort city of San Carlos de Bariloche. And by Thursday afternoon, much ash had made its way to Villa La Angostura, Argentina, a small town about 56 miles (90 kilometers) northeast of the volcano. Cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash, but people were otherwise going about their business. 'We are praying that the volcanic activity will be as short as possible,' said mayor Roberto Cacault. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert on Wednesday and set up an exclusion zone of 12 miles around the volcano. Ominous: The first eruption (pictured) sent a huge plume of gas and ash soaring into the atmosphere which was visible from up to 100 miles away . Active: Calbuco (pictured yesterday) is one of Chile's three most dangerous volcanoes and part of an active chain of around 500 that cover the south of the country . Incredible: Smoke and lava shot out of Calbuco yesterday as people watched on from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas (pictured) Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas (pictured) went about their business as Calbuco exploded, but local authorities setting up a 12.5-mile exclusion zone around it . Destructive: Volcanoes like Calbuco (pictured) occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust . Plume: While most people think of volcanoes as spewing lava, many eruptions take the form of super-heated gas and ash (pictured) which is pushed through the earth's crust, covering the sky . Trevor Moffat who lives in Ensenada - some six miles from the volcano - said the eruption yesterday happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust. Danger: Residents from nearby towns said people were crying in the streets after the volcano erupted without warning at 6pm local time . Shocking: While the first eruption occurred in the middle of the afternoon, the plume of ash and smoke was visible well into the evening from towns 100 miles away in Argentina . Blanket: The last major eruption here was in 1961 when lava flows filled the top crater before spilling down the sides and into a nearby lake . Distant: A view of the ash cloud from the Nahuel Huapi lake, around 100 miles away from the volcano in neighbouring Argentina .","A second terrifying eruption from the Calbuco volcano in southern Chile has forced over 4,000 to leave their homes .
The cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt are covered in ash and locals are becoming frightened for their health .
Yesterday's blast, which shot ash six miles into the air, was the first since 1972 and the first major one since 1961 .
No one is thought to have died from the two explosions but Chile's president has declared a state of emergency .",1818,81

'Instead of the open spaces that have been described to them, they landed here with steep hills rising in front of this narrow beach,' he said.

969259da64cf9b0dc2baad462561d1c4e203da45,"Manchester United have confirmed their plans to revisit the USA on pre-season this summer after agreeing to Louis van Gaal’s desire to head to America rather than Asia. United’s shirt sponsors Chevrolet are keen for the club to visit the Far East as the American car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer. However, after months of discussions between the United board and manager Van Gaal the club will once again head across the Atlantic for a four-game tour signed off by the manager. Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States will see them play Louis van Gaal's ex-club Barca . The pre-season plans have been organised to Van Gaal's liking after he was unhappy last year in USA . The Premier League giants will face Club America, San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona and PSG . United will play once again in the International Champions’ Cup, the tournament they won in America last summer. This time, though, with Van Gaal’s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger, the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to England on July 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the Barclays Premier League season on August 8. July 17 - vs Club America . CenturyLink Field, Seattle - 72,000 capacity . July 21 - vs San Jose Earthquakes . TBC . July 25 - vs Barcelona . Levi's Stadium, California - 68,500 capacity . July 29 - vs Paris Saint-Germain . Soldier Field, Chicago - 61,500 capacity . Van Gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling United had to do as they zig-zagged around America, playing games in Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. This time, United will be based largely on the west coast, playing games against Club America in Seattle, San Jose Earthquakes, at a venue to be announced and Barcelona near San Francisco before facing PSG in Chicago on the way home. As revealed earlier this month in Sportsmail, the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer’s tournament around United’s needs. For example, there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer’s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated Van Gaal having to take his team to Miami for four days for a game he really had no desire to play. It is understood that United will use Seattle as their base before their first game this summer. Next summer’s tour, meanwhile, will almost certainly be to Asia, a continent United haven’t visited since David Moyes’ pre-season of 2013.

37c8a045c17218da8466636e19346acdec501273,"The son of a well known nightclub owner who bragged about taking a girl's virginity in an alley is appealing his rape conviction. Luke Lazarus, a 23-year-old former private school boy, was jailed for at least three years on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old virgin in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub in Kings Cross, inner Sydney in May 2013. Lazarus hired Back Schwartz Vaughan - a liquor licensing specialist law firm, who lodged the appeal five days after the conviction, also contested the five year-maximum sentence he received, Fairfax Media reported. Scroll down for video . Luke Lazarus was sentenced on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub on May 12, 2013 . In the victim's impact statement, which was read out at court on her behalf, the woman said she will never be the same following the brutal attack. 'I thought that once I left the alleyway the pain would go away ... but it didn't,' the statement said. 'Everything that made me who I was stayed in that alleyway.' Lazarus said he thought the sex was consensual and that fact that it wasn't made him: 'absolutely sick to my stomach'. When sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. During Luke Lazarus's rape trial, the jury were told he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway . This comes as Eastern Sydney's Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a glowing reference for Lazarus 'out of loyalty to the family' after he raped an 18-year-old woman in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub, in Sydney. Now the controversial councillor is developing 'a new risky behaviour education program to try and help young women understand and better deal with being in vulnerable situations'. In an interview with the Wentworth Courier she referenced the behaviour of Lazarus's victim. The Mayor of three years said: 'By the sheer fact of (the assault) happening at a nightclub and alcohol is involved, (means people are) open to the possibility of risky behaviour, so I'm saying let's try and close that loophole.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Cr Betts for comment. Cr Betts is reportedly developing the program for school girls alongside Waverley Action for Youth Services (WAYS) and the police. During Lazarus's trial, the jury was told that he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into the alleyway. The court heard that during the assault he pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for convicted rapist Luke Lazarus and is now developing 'a new risky behaviour education program' for young women . When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had. In a text message to a friend the afternoon after the attack, in the early hours of May 12, 2013, Lazarus said: 'I honestly have zero recollection of calling you ... Was a sick night – took a chick's virginity.' His friend replied: 'bahahahaha nice popping does cherries ... ' Lazarus replied: '... it's a pretty gross story tell ya later'. Cr Betts said in the character reference she wrote for Lazarus that his conviction was 'inconsistent with the gentle well-mannered and respectful young man that I know'. She also said she had no hesitation supporting Lazarus and his family. In a recent interview with the Wentworth Courier she said she wrote the reference in support of Lazarus's grandparents whom she has been friends with for 30 years. 'They are shocked and devastated and I wrote in support of them,' she said. Sally Betts has been the Mayor of Waverley for three years in Sydney's eastern suburbs . Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward slammed the public figures in the local community who supported Lazarus. Along with Cr Betts, the honorary secretary of the Honorary Consulate-General of Greece in Brisbane, Tsambico K Athanasas, South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club chairman Nick Pappas and the parish priest at the Greek Orthodox Christian Church of St George, Rose Bay, Father Gerasimos Koutsouras, spoke out to support him. 'Not only does this diminish their standing, it can shatter the confidence of the victim and often discourages them from seeking justice,' she said. On Thursday, Federal Member for Wentworth and Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull, whose electorate takes in Betts' council area, refused to endorse her to continue in her position. Turnbull's office declined to respond when probed by the Guardian over whether he would support her as mayor. A council investigation is currently underway to determine whether she broke the code of conduct. On Facebook a campaign page with over 200 likes has begun calling for her removal from office. 'As a community we must stand against our elected leaders supporting convicted rapists. Sally Betts Mayor of Waverley needs to know that she must go,' the page says. Luke Lazarus will spend a minimum of three years behind bars. He told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement' A photo of a drunken looking young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3 by an 'external promoter' Last week, nightclub promoters apologised after a photo of a young woman sprawled out on a tiled-floor was used to advertise their Easter weekend event - just a week after Lazarus was convicted of raping a teenage girl at the venue. A photo of a 'drunken' young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3. The photo's caption said: 'We're throwing an extra special Yeezter event Tonight. Free entry till 10pm and $5 drinks till midnight – get amongst it!' The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter, the Daily Life reports, with one shocked social media user complaining: 'This is how Luke Lazarus (sic) father promotes nightclub SOHO. Posted week after sentencing!'. A Twitter user told Daily Mail Australia : 'Once it did Twitter rounds and people started commenting it was removed by Saturday.' A SOHO management spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'The event on the night was set up by an external promoter as a one-off event.

9348553b29537d7cc8101d9471df47fad3a9c4fc,"An Ohio woman discovered that her biological mother worked at the same company as her and lived only six minutes away. The Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month, allowing people their first access to the information. After receiving her records in the mail, La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark, 38, of Youngstown, finally got the answers she's wanted almost her whole life. She looked up her mother's name, Francine Simmons, on Facebook and found out she worked Infocision - the same call-center operation company she works at. La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark (left) of Youngstown, Ohio, found out her birth mother was Francine Simmons (right) after the Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month . 'Ever since I found out that I was adopted I wanted to know who my biological mother was,' Mitchell-Clark told WYTV. And after connecting the dots, she realized her mother was closer than she could imagine. 'There's a Francine that works at my job,' she said after finding the woman on Facebook. 'She works in VR and she works at the front desk.' She reached out to friends on social media who knew Simmons and the next day she got a phone call from her birth mother. 'She called me and I said, ""Is this Ms. Francine?"" She said, yes. I said, ""I think I'm your daughter"",' Mitchell-Clark said about the first time the women spoke. And, as it turns out, the mother and daughter live just six minutes away from one another in Youngstown. Simmons said she was 'still in shock' from finding out about her daughter, who she always wanted to contact but never knew how. Mitchell-Clark (left) reached out through social media to speak with Simmons (right) and they eventually decided to meet after a phone call. They found out they work at the came call-center operations company and live six minutes away from one another . Mitchell-Clark also found out that she had three biological younger sisters. Two of the sisters, Kamala (left) and Maisha (right) Cummings, said that the reunion was 'a relief' and 'amazing' for their family . 'I got pregnant when I was 14. I had her when I was 15. I was put in a home, a girl's home. Had her. Got to hold her. Didn't get to name her, but I named her myself in my heart all these years,' Simmons told WYTV. Mitchell-Clark also found out that she has three younger sisters she didn't know about. Simmons's daughter Kamala Cummings said that meeting Mitchell-Clark has been 'a sense of relief' for  her family, particularly for her mother. 'It's just amazing that all this time we're thinking about her and trying to find her and she was trying to find us, too,'  Maisha Cummings, another daughter of Simmons, told WYTV. Mitchell-Clark said that her adoptive parents have been very supportive of her search for her biological parents. '(They've) always encouraged me to look for them. They're going to be a part of this, too,' she said.","The Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month .

ae21a33540862601d14c0dd7c2a24eb0430c02f4,"A mother whose twins were born so early they spent their first two months in intensive care has revealed she almost lost her son Mason a second time after he contracted an extremely rare virus. Lauren Perry, 25, had her waters break just 23 weeks into her pregnancy, and doctors feared the worst. Her twins Mason and Chloe were delivered early via an emergency caesarean at 30 weeks. Lauren Perry's (right) son, Mason (pictured with sister Chloe and dad Mitch Window), contracted a flesh-eating disease . But the parents' fears for the lives of their newborns did not end there. Eight months later when Mason was admitted to hospital to have his colostomy removed he nearly lost his life to a dangerous flesh-eating virus. It perforated his bowel and ate tissue from his chest cavity. 'He had his colostomy when he was one-day-old so we had to wait until he was much older and bigger to have it removed,' Ms Perry told Daily Mail Australia. She was forced to deliver her twins via caesarean 10 weeks early after he water broke at 30 weeks . Eight months later when Mason was admitted to hospital to have his colostomy removed he nearly lost his life to a dangerous flesh-eating virus . After the surgery, Mason (pictured with his parents) - who was eight months at the time - started going down hill pretty quickly . About a month ago, Mason - who was eight months old - was admitted to Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane to have his colostomy removed, in what his mother described as a 'pretty routine operation'. After the surgery, the young boy went into recovery, but started to go downhill quickly. 'We were holding him and over a few hours he became really hot and had a fever,' Ms Perry revealed. 'His vital signs were dropping and he was having trouble breathing.' 'His stomach just tripled in size and had this red purple rash all over him, and as a mum you just know when something's not right.' Fortunately, Mason recovered from the virus. Here he is seen with his scar after having his colostomy removed . Ms Perry said her son's vital signs started dropping and he was having trouble breathing after the surgery . The infection had eaten all the tissue in Mason's chest and abdomen, leaving him fighting for his life . When the doctor who performed Mason's initial surgery came to check on the infant, he immediately rushed the baby back into theatre for an emergency procedure. 'It was a bug that pretty much just ate all the tissue in his chest and abdomen,' the twins' mother said. 'They said if we'd waited another hour or two he would have definitely died, it attacks so quickly,' Ms Perry added. Mason had contracted necrotising fasciitis, a serious rapidly spreading infection that results in death of tissue. 'It can be fatal if symptoms go undetected - approximately 25 per cent of patients with necrotising fasciitis and more than 30 per cent with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome die,' Fionnagh Dougan, Chief Executive of Children's Health Queensland, told Daily Mail Australia. 'A combination of bacteria caused Mason's case of necrotising fasciitis.' Ms Perry revealed after such a tough few months early on in Chloe and Mason's life, she did not know what to expect when he fell ill again . Thankfully Mason is now doing better but his mum says he is not quite back to normal just yet . Ms Perry said her and her partner were simply grateful for all the moments they got to share with their twins . Ms Perry praised the work of doctors at Lady Cilento where her son was treated, describing their work as 'amazing'. Ms Doughan echoed this. 'The speed at which Lady Cilento Children's Hospital clinicians identified Mason's symptoms was paramount to his recover,' Ms Doughan said. 'Mason’s treatment included the rapid administration of intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical removal of dying tissue as required. 'We were delighted that Mason responded quickly to the range of antibiotics prescribed to combat the bacteria.' Ms Perry revealed after such a tough few months early on in Chloe and Mason's life, she did not know what to expect when he fell ill again. When her waters broke at 23 weeks, the doctor's prognosis was nothing short of grim. 'They said that normally when your waters break you go into labour within 24 hours and they said that would probably happen,' Ms Perry said. 'They said they couldn't resuscitate a baby that small... so they said it would probably be best to wrap them up and keep them warm and cuddle them for as long as we can.' Luckily after a few hurdles, the twins were able to go home after eight weeks, but when Mason got sick again she thought she may never get to take her little boy home for good. 'I honestly thought I would never get to take him home. I remember just collapsing on the floor with my dad and saying ""That's my baby. What am I going to do if he dies?""' Ms Perry said. Thankfully Mason is now doing better but his mum says he is not quite back to normal. 'I think the professor that operated that said he's never seen something like what happened to Mason and he's lucky to be alive,' Ms Perry said. 'He's not himself, he doesn't want to be put down, and he was starting to crawl and sit up but he can't do that. 'I think he still feels very vulnerable.' But Ms Perry said her and her partner, Mitch Window, were simply grateful for all the moments they got to share with their twins. 'We don't take anything for granted,' she said.","Lauren Perry, 25, gave birth to her twins 10 weeks early at just 30 weeks .

718bef83d4e7498f75fb45e3ab23809552b5ea1f,"Veteran CBS News 'Face the Nation' moderator Bob Schieffer announced Tuesday at the Texas journalism school named for him that he'll be retiring this summer. It's not his first retirement announcement but, at age 78, looks like it has a good chance of sticking. Schieffer was speaking to students at an annual symposium that bears his name at Texas Christian University's Schieffer School of Journalism in Fort Worth, his alma mater. 'It's been a great adventure,' Schieffer said at the college. 'You know, I'm one of the luckiest people in the world because as a little boy, as a young reporter, I always wanted to be a journalist, and I got to do that. 'And not many people get to do that, and I couldn't have asked for a better life or something that was more fun and more fulfilling.' Bob Schieffer opens the Schieffer Symposium on the News at TCU on Wednesday, April 8, 2015, in Fort Worth, Texas. CBS says veteran newsman Schieffer is retiring this year . Career: Schieffer began at the political affairs show 'Face the Nation' in 1991, asking direct questions to politicians in a Texas twang . Announcement: Schieffer also posted the news of his retirement to his Twitter account Wednesday night . New career option: Country singer Brad Paisley joked about what Schieffer might do after stepping down from his job with CBS News . On Wednesday night, Schieffer tweeted 'Great talking journalism at @TCU tonight. Also really happy to be in my hometown, where it all started, to announce my retirement.' Journalists and media personalities have been discussing Stelter's announcement on social media. CBS This Morning Anchor Gayle King, who was present when the news broke, uploaded a photograph of Schieffer to Instagram, along with the caption 'Oh what a nite ! @bob schieffer announces he is RETIRInG . . A class act and his announcement stunned the audience at the schieffer symposium.' CNN's Brian Stelter wrote Twitter 'Sandy Livingston, who was at Schieffer announcement in TX: ""It was a stunner to the audience. There were some gasps; I heard some 'Oh nos'""' 'Bob Schieffer announces retirement from an amazing career: at CBS since '69, hosting Face the Nation since '91. Trusted by both sides,' Fox News' Howard Kurtz tweeted. CNN's Jake Tapper and The Drudge Report's Matt Drudge were also among those who paid tribute to Schieffer on Twitter. Big reveal: CBS This Morning Anchor Gayle King said Schieffer's announcement 'stunned' Stay tuned: King also uploaded this shot of Schieffer to Instagram after the news broke . Tribute: CNN news anchor Jake Tapper called Schieffer a 'legend' Wednesday night . He will be missed: Matt Drudge also said he was 'sad to see' Schieffer retire . A former newspaper reporter at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Schieffer joined CBS News in 1969 and has been the network's chief Washington correspondent since 1992. He began at the political affairs show 'Face the Nation' in 1991, asking direct questions to politicians in a Texas twang. He had an unexpected career highlight starting in 2005, filling in as anchor of the 'CBS Evening News' following Dan Rather's exit for a year and a half until Katie Couric took over the role. His folksy style got good reviews, boosted ratings and healed morale at the news division following the network's discredited report on President George W. Bush's military service. Schieffer survived bladder cancer about a decade ago, a brush with mortality that was one factor in his 2008 announcement that he would retire with the inauguration of a new president in January 2009. That inauguration came and went and Schieffer stayed. He was enjoying the job too much. The death of NBC's Tim Russert, whose 'Meet the Press' led in the ratings for many years, opened Sunday morning to a tighter competition. 'Face the Nation' often led, and CBS responded by expanding the show to an hour. 'I know what you're thinking,' CBS News President David Rhodes said in a memo to his staff Tuesday. 'Bob's thought about retiring before, is he really retiring now? And of course with his long connection to CBS News we'd be happy to learn that he's not leaving now, or that he can be seen by our viewers in the future.' But Rhodes said Schieffer wanted to announce the end of his career where it all began. Rhodes called him 'an inspiration and a mentor to so many colleagues - and, frankly, to me.' CBS would not talk Tuesday about potential successors at 'Face the Nation.' Schieffer hasn't had a single substitute when he took time off; Charlie Rose, Norah O'Donnell, Major Garrett, John Dickerson and Nancy Cordes have all filled in at different times. His chief competitors are Chuck Todd at 'Meet the Press' and George Stephanopoulos at ABC's 'This Week.' Rhodes told Politico '[Schieffer] felt very strongly about doing this at TCU. He's been really deveoted to us, he's had such a long career here - but he's also made a huge investment in TCU. 'His wife is still on the board, his name is on both the journalism and the communications school. He and I have been talking about this for a long time.' CBS News quoted Schieffer as saying Wednesday 'We like any large organization we have had our ups and downs; we're on a high right now. ""Face the Nation,"" I think, is better than it has ever been.'

f4bf9535d69aedcaa2ffeeab6798cb9e7bd77700,"The surviving daughters of a mother who has been imprisoned for strangling six of her children to death moments after they were born are standing by their murderous mom. Megan Huntsman, 40, is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to killing the six newborns, then stashing their bodies in the garage of her home in Pleasant Grove, Utah. A judge today handed Huntsman six sentences of five years to life - but family members rallied round her even as her 'cold and calculated' crimes were recounted to the court. Scroll down for video . Prison: Megan Huntsman, 40, was today given six terms of five years to life in prison after admitting the murders. Three will run consecutively, which means she will spend at least 15 years in prison - and likely much longer. She is pictured today in court . Grisly: Investigators are shown above searching Huntsman's garage, where a total of seven baby corpses were found in cardboard boxes. One of the children was stillborn - Huntsman strangled the rest . Huntsman, a meth addict, told police that she started killing off her children when she got pregnant because her drug problem meant she couldn't care for them. Local reports from the courtroom told how Hunstman's attorney took to the stand and read out letters from two of her daughters, who were born before her addiction began. The letters drew a stark contrast between the loving mother they say they knew, and the type of woman who would kill her own flesh and blood on six different occasions. Her mother, Joyce Huntsman, was reportedly in court - and took the stand to tearfully defend her daughter despite the heinous crimes. Discovery: Hunstman, left, was arrested after her estranged husband Darren West, right, found the bodies in her garage. West, who previously served time in prison, is not considered a suspect in their deaths . Scene: Her estranged husband found one of the babies' bodies while cleaning out the garage at her Pleasent Grove, Utah home, pictured, in April last year . She told the court that the woman who committed the crimes was 'not my Megan'. According to the KSL local news station, a detective recounted Huntsman's cold and deliberate method of execution. Unwitting: West, pictured after the sentencing, is thought not have known nothing about the murders . The officer said Huntsman told she would take the babies in her hands when they were just minutes old. Then, he said, she would press on their necks with her thumbs until they choked to death. She would then put their tiny bodies in . Ultimately the corpses of seven babies were found - one of which was determined to have been stillborn. The crimes were uncovered by Huntsman's husband Darren West - now estranged - who called police when he found the first body. The births and murders are said to have taken place from 1996 to 2006. According to stunned neighbors when she was arrested, Huntsman was 'perpetually slim' and they would never have suspected she was pregnant. The sentences handed down to Huntsman today were the maximum possible for her crimes. Three of them will be served consecutively - meaning she will spend a minimum of 15 years inside, and likely much longer. The sentence brings closure to a case that sent shockwaves through the quiet, mostly Mormon community where Huntsman stored the tiny bodies for more than a decade. The small city of Pleasant Grove is south of Salt Lake City.","Megan Huntsman, 40, pleaded guilty to the six murders in February .

99cf9445070699b6fb3727ed7809a89ec026796d,"Friends of murdered Indiana University student Hannah Wilson have said she was last seen at the same bar where Lauren Spierer partied before she vanished in 2011. Wilson's body was found in rural Brown County, about 10 miles from the campus, on Friday morning after a night out. Daniel Messel, 49, was arrested hours later and has been charged in her death. Circumstances of her disappearance are 'eerily similar' to the case of 20-year-old Spierer, police told Fox59, and they will be looking into the case again. Spierer vanished after a night out at Kilroy's Sports Bar in Bloomington with a group of friends nearly four years ago. Her body has never been found and no criminal charges have ever been filed. 'Eerily similar': Student Hannah Wilson, left, was found murdered hours after leaving a bar in Bloomington, Indiana last week - nearly four years after Lauren Spierer, right, vanished after leaving the same bar . On Monday, Wilson's friends said she had been partying in downtown Bloomington  and they were also going to go to Kilroy's Sports Bar, but deemed that she was too drunk to join them there. The group put Wilson into a taxi alone around 1am on Friday and gave the driver her address. Her body was found near Lake Lemon at around 8.30am. She died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to the county coroner, and preliminary results of an autopsy show she was struck three or four times in the back of the head with an object. Her only other injuries were superficial abrasions and bruises that the coroner said were protective, rather than defensive, wounds. 'Like trying to prevent her head from being hit,' he told The Herald-Times. Wilson was found fully clothed and there was no sign of sexual assault, police told Sky News. Toxicology reports for the woman will not be available for ten to 14 days. Police said they traced a cellphone found near Wilson's feet to Daniel Messel and after they arrested him, investigators found blood in his vehicle, according to a probable cause affidavit. Arrested: Daniel Messel, 49, has been arrested on suspicion of her murder. A cellphone that police traced back to Messel was found at Wilson's feet and investigators allegedly found blood inside his vehicle . Last seen: Her friends went to this bar in Bloomington but, thinking that Wilson was too drunk, put her in a taxi to go home. Spierer also spent time at the same bar before she vanished in 2011 . Messel's stepfather, Gerald Messel, told Fox59 that the man spoke of meeting a girl called 'Hannah' at bars near the university campus ahead of her death. Gerald Messel, who lives with his stepson, said he was surprised when the man failed to come home on Thursday evening and he failed to go to work the next day. When Daniel Messel arrived back home, he was arrested by police, he said. Troopers have confiscated his computer, phone and vehicle. This is also not Messel's first run in with the police, according the the Indiana Daily Student. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and endangering persons in 1995. A year later, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for battery by means of a deadly weapon and battery resulting in serious bodily injury. The president of the Panhellenic Association at Indiana University has organized a fund will go towards providing one full year of room and board for Wilson's sister (above Wilson pictured with her father) Wilson, originally from Fishers, Indiana, was a senior studying psychology at the university. Friends held multiple vigils for the beloved student over the weekend. In one of the vigils, around 1,500 students comforted each other as they assembled on Saturday evening at the campus' Alumni Hall. Balloons were released from the building's solarium by her Gamma Phi Beta sorority sisters. Wilson's mother and sister were present at the memorial and were shielded by family and friends who shared fond memories of her, according to the Indy Star. Indiana University spokesman Mark Land said 'the entire IU Bloomington community mourns the tragic death of Hannah Wilson.' 'Our deepest sympathies go out to Hannah's family and friends during this unspeakably sad time,' he said in a statement. 'She was the kind of girl who made everybody feel special,' Maggie Hadley, one of Wilson's former Indiana Elite teammates told The Indianapolis Star.      H .

ca3b2dc93f170f06e3a60fe7cd3243d204cc4b75,"Former paramedic Crsity Collins had admitted that she used ice while driving and treating patients in an effort to raise awareness about the damaging drug . A former ice addict, who worked as a paramedic while high on the drug, has made her story public in an attempt to raise awareness of the illegal substance and the lack of support available for its victims. Crsity Collins was using crystal meth every day and spending up to $500 a week to keep up her drug habit. The 30-year-old, who took herself to the emergency room six times while suffering drug induced psychosis, has slammed health services for failing to offer her support despite claiming on numerous occasions that bugs were eating her eyes. 'Because I was awake all the time I had a staph infection, but I actually believed I might have bugs in my eyes and when I went to hospital, I was having drug-induced psychosis, I would say I had mites in my eyes or fleas or bugs, ' Ms Collins told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not once was I ever asked ""are you on meth or taking drugs or are you having a drug induced psychosis"" or ""should we get a social worker or a psych assessment"". 'I don't know if they were trying to protect me because I was in the ambulance service, but either way they shouldn't have been protecting me because firstly, I was dealing with people and patients and secondly, like anyone else I deserve the best treatment and care. 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor.' The 30-year-old said she was never offered support despite checking herself into the emergency room on six occasions (right) while claiming that she had bugs in her eyes (left) 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor,' she said . Ms Collins, whose addiction was fuelled by her post traumatic stress disorder and a borderline personality disorder, first began using illegal drugs recreationally, and first tried meth, while living in Darwin. However her habit ironically escalated when she attempted to escape the city an its 'party scene' by moving back to Launceston in Tasmania, where she rekindled a relationship with an ex-boyfriend who was part of 'the same sort of scene'. 'I didn't have any friends that weren't using drugs. Everyone had it around. Pills weren't easy to come across in Launceston, it was always speed and then ice took over,' Ms Collins said. 'It made me feel like superwoman - I could do anything and run on barely any sleep, so it became something I was using on a very frequent basis. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had.' Ms Collins has now been clean for nine months after seeking help from the Department of Veterans Affairs . She said that it was when she and her now ex-boyfriend broke up that she became a daily user of the drug, even when driving and treating patients as an ambulance worker, but that none of her colleagues appeared to notice. 'I never felt affected. I never had any close calls where I could have put someone in danger. I was always very good at my job, very on the ball with patient care, and that why I was never suspected,' Ms Collins said. 'When I look back, I find it absolutely disgraceful. I could have had psychosis at any stage or changed my awareness or sense of judgement - it's such an unpredictable drug. 'I'd hate to know that anyone I know was being taken care of by someone that is hungover or on any form of drug that would alter their sense of awareness, let alone ice. 'But it wasn't until I started taking lots of sick days because my eyes were flaring-up form being awake all the time that anyone noticed something was wrong, and even then it was like they were more worried that I wouldn't have any leave left rather than that my health was deteriorating.' Sores from obsessive picking: She said that traking the drug used to make her feel 'like superwoman' Ms Collins has now been clean for more than nine months after finding free help with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which she was directed to by pure chance after being arrested. 'I was on my way to a dealer's house and got pulled over. My car was raided and they found drugs and when then let me out on bail to appear at court, a police officer who was a reservist said ""you need to get yourself together"" and told me to see Veterans Affairs,' she said. Unlike at the single out-patient facility in Launceston, which was run by nurses and social workers but had no councillors, Ms Collins found intensive help that assessed the root of her drug addiction and uncovered her mental health problems. She now has effective strategies in place with her councillor to deal with her borderline personality disorder and anxiety, which used to lead her to take drugs as a coping mechanism, as well as the post-traumatic stress disorder she acquired while working in Iraq as a medic for six months. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had,' Ms Collins said . 'I was partially stressed [while in Iraq] because I was the only female in that group, so I didn't want to make mistakes and I wanted to fit in with the men,' she said. 'Then there was the constant artillery and bombings we'd get in the compound… it didn't feel like it affected me there, but when I came back I would hear loud bands and instantly hide or duck for cover. I'd be constantly looking for bombs on the side of the roads, it was a habit there and when I got home I couldn't get out of it.' She is not living with her family who provide her with emotional and finical support after she left her job and isolated herself from damaging social groups, and is actively looking for her next line of work. Ms Collins wants to use her story to raise awareness about the 'epidemic of ice users' in Tasmania, where she said middle and higher class users were very common . 'In Tasmania there is becoming an epidemic of ice users and ice related crime, so if it can help even just a few people, then I'm more than happy to share my story,' she said. 'It's not just the lower socio-economic groups in society that we should concentrate on, it's happening everywhere - the drug doesn't discriminate and it's happening in the higher class and the middle classes. You need to have money to use it. 'There's no drug testing in people that we hold in high regards, like paramedics, police and firies - pilots have to have drug tests and paramedics should be made to have these tests too.'","Cristy Collins worked for the Tasmanian Ambulance Service in Launceston .

6f4fe445a15e5db6227f022c0ddd23404eb57a6b,"A bakery in Oregon has been told to pay $135,000 to a lesbian couple that it refused to make a wedding cake for two years ago. An administrative law judge said that Sweet Cakes by Melissa, in the Portland suburb of Gresham, discriminated against Rachel Bowman-Cryer and her wife Laurel and caused them emotional suffering. Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron refused to make the couple, who held a commitment ceremony in June 2013, a cake after learning that they were lesbians in January of that year because they disapprove of gay marriage for religious reasons. The Kleins were able to raise more than $100,000 from anonymous donors on a fundraising page before it was shut down for violating GoFundMe's terms of service. Melissa Klein (behind counter) of Sweet Cakes by Melissa faces a $135,000 fine after being found guilty of discriminating against a lesbian couple when she and her husband refused to make them a wedding cake . Rachel Bowman-Cryer (right) and her wife Laurel (left) file a civil rights lawsuit and said that they had suffered emotional distress because of the case after they received death threats . The judge's Friday verdict comes after the Bowman-Cryers filed a civil rights suit in the case, which has joined a series of similar proceedings in a national debate about anti-LGBT discrimination and religious freedom. They said during compensation hearings that they had received death threats and were worried about losing their two foster children after the case received widespread attention, according to Oregon Live. Oregon prohibits businesses from discriminating based on sexual orientation and the Christian bakers are were found guilty of discrimination earlier this year. The bakery must pay up to $150,000, and the judge's Friday decision of $135,000 will be approved or amended by State Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian. A ruling issued by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries saying that the Kleins discriminated also rejected their argument that she did not discriminate against the couple because she had previously sold Rachel Cryer a cake for her mother's wedding. Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron (right), who closed their bakery in 2013 amid attention to the discrimination case, say they are in dire financial straits because of the fine . An administrative law court in Oregon ruled earlier this year against the Klein's defense that their constitutional right to expression of their religious beliefs superseded Oregon state law against discrimination . The Kleins, who closed their store in 2013 amid attention drawn to the discrimination and now operate it from their home, have said that they and their five children are struggling financially. 'This is real money that Aaron and Melissa are going to have to pay that otherwise would be used to pay their mortgage and feed their kids,' their lawyer Anna Harmon told the Oregonian. The bakery's Facebook page posted a message Friday saying that the fine 'will financially ruin us'. A GoFundMe page for the family has already raised $101,000 as of Friday night. The page, which has set its goal at $200,000, says that any excess funds will be given to 'will be used to cover those same expenses for others who defend their constitutional right to live consistently with their faith.' However, the fundraising site later shut down the couple's page for violating the company's terms of service. 'The subjects of the ""Support Sweet Cakes By Melissa"" campaign have been formally charged by local authorities and found to be in violation of Oregon state law concerning discriminatory acts. Accordingly, the campaign has been disabled,' the site told Go Local PDX. The Klein's said that 'Satan's really at work' after 'he administrators of gofundme because they claimed it was raising money for an illegal purpose'. The family will still receive the $100,000 they raised, though it is now urging potential donors to give them money on a fundraising site run by Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham. A lawyer for the Bowman-Cryers said Friday about the $135,000 amount that 'This is a proposed order and we view this matter as continuing to be active litigation', refusing to comment further. The case follows similar incidents in Colorado, where a Christian baker who refused to bake a wedding reception cake for a gay couple was found to have discriminated against them in 2013. The Bowman-Cryers said they were worried about losing their foster children, who they have since adopted, after attention was brought to their marriage. Oregon began allowing same sex marriage in May 2014 . A GoFundMe page for the bakery started Friday afternoon raised more than $100,000 in eight hours for the Klein's legal expenses . Another baker in the state who refused to bake cakes with Bible quotes and anti-gay messages was found not to have discriminated the Christian customer earlier this year. Indiana passed a law that many saw as allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT people earlier this year, though it has since amended it to say that discrimination is not allowed. A pizza parlor in the state that said it would deny service to gay couples raised more than $840,000 from donors online after it closed following backlash on social media for its decision. A CNN poll taken last week found that 57 per cent of Americans think that wedding-related businesses such as cake bakers should not be allowed to deny service to same sex couples. Oregon has allowed gay marriage since 2014, when its ban was struck down by a federal court for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Bownman-Cryers married in May that year, shortly after the judge's decision, according to the Statesman Journal. They have since adopted their foster children, two daughters aged eight and six. The state's law on discrimination against gay people makes exceptions for religious institutions such as schools and churches.","Sweet Cakes by Melissa in Oregon found to have discriminated against lesbian couple by refusing them wedding cake in January 2013 .

0ba1dc167831450187cb6bb7dc4da7ba18aea129,"Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. Etan's body was never found, nor was any trace of clothing or his belongings. He had never been considered a suspect - his name appears only once in law enforcement paperwork at the time Etan disappeared. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ. A teenage stock clerk at the corner shop, Hernandez knew there were children in and out of the store, and Etan had been there countless times, the prosecutor said. She said Hernandez saw Etan with a dollar and calculated he wanted a drink, so he asked him to the basement. 'Day after day he saw this beautiful little boy,' she said. 'One day, he acted on an impulse and did something terrible to this little boy.' She said the motive was sexual, and Etan likely fought back. 'The quickest and easiest way to shut him up and shut him up permanently was to choke him to death,' she said. Rosemary Hernandez, left, and Becky Hernandez, the wife and daughter of Pedro Hernandez, arrive for court in New York, on Wednesday . Stanley Patz, left, the father of Etan Patz, arrives for court on Wednesday, although his estranged wife Julie, right, hasn't been pictured at court in recent days . Illuzzi-Orbon said his first confession to a prayer group shortly after the boy disappeared was the most accurate - he was confessing to God, and he was trying to unburden himself. Prayer circle members testified that Hernandez made tearful admissions during a 1979 retreat that matched some of what he told authorities on video 33 years later: He gave a child a soda, took him to the store basement and choked him. Two said Hernandez also admitted abusing the boy; when talking to police, Hernandez denied molesting Etan. A former neighbor and his ex-wife also testified he told them about killing someone in New York. The Maple Shade, New Jersey, man made the stunning admissions to police after authorities received a tip from a relative who saw news reports of the case in 2012. Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'I grabbed him by the neck and started choking him,' said Hernandez, now 54. 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the confession video shows 'a man sitting there convinced he killed a child - on a day that he doesn't know, at a time he doesn't know, at a location near a bus stop that he doesn't know.' The defense has suggested that the real killer is a convicted pedophile jailed in Pennsylvania who was the longtime suspect in the case. That man, Jose Ramos, denies involvement. However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. 'Two confessions,' Fishbein said. 'Which person is more likely to have been a predator?' Etan's photo was one of the first on milk cartons. The day he went missing, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. Etan Patz's 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement .","Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez, the man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979 .

6a4e4e1bd32260efbcd354ace9a4903b32ba1327,"Rita Wilson appears with an ensemble of actresses in a satirical new video promoting gender equality which ironically proclaims: 'It's only fair that men should have it all.' The clip, which was created by the Make it Fair Project, presents a string of statistics that highlight the disproportionate presence that men have in influential industries like Hollywood, which means that, more often than not, males hold 70 to 95 per cent of the industry’s most important positions. 'We won't relent 'til it's 100 per cent,' the women sing in a tongue-in-cheek refrain that repeats throughout the PSA. Scroll down for video . Poor guys: Rita Wilson pretends to be sad that men don't completely dominate film industry in a new gender-equality PSA by the Make it Fair Project . 'In the past three years, only 93 per cent of films were directed by men, and only 80 per cent were written by them,' the actresses, including Meryl Streep’s actress daughter Mamie Gummer, say at the beginning of the video. They go on to note, completely dead-pan, that in 2014, 'only' 88 per cent of box office hits featured a man in the leading role. 'Sadly', they say, 'only' 70 per cent of speaking roles in films are also given to men, and women 'get to be naked' in movies twice as often as men do. The problem exists even on the Broadway stage, they point out, with 13 out of 13 plays last year being written by men. Speaking up: Actress Mamie Gummer (pictured, in a photograph by Nadia Quinn) sings in the video that it's 'only fair that men should have it all', not just 80 or 90 per cent of an industry . Far-reaching issue: Though the actresses highlight gender inequality in Hollywood, they also point out similar problems in government and Fortune 500 companies . Rita, who is known for her roles in Sleepless in Seattle and Runaway Bride, looks distressed as she lists the unfavorable statistics. The video comes just weeks after Rita revealed her battle with cancer and double mastectomy. Now, the actress, who has had devoted husband Tom Hanks by her side, is making more headlines for speaking out about another issue that effects women, this time in the film industry. But while these actresses have a particular interest in Hollywood's status quo, they insist that 'showbiz' isn't the only place where there is startling gender inequality. 'Men make up only 88 per cent of Congress, 80 per cent of governors, 95 per cent of Fortune 500 CEOs, [and] 97 per cent of creative directors in advertising,' they continue. No laughing matter: The cast of actresses sing and clap in an imitation of musical numbers performed during more serious telethons and PSAs . Social savvy: The creators of the project are promoting their message on social media with the hashtag #MakeItFair . Making a point: The YoutTube video was created by an all-female crew to demonstrate the range of talented women available . The women also point out that men continue to hold the top roles in big industries and get paid 30 per cent more than women despite the fact that women make up almost 60 per cent of college graduates. The group wraps up with a rousing telethon-style musical number, singing together: 'We stand here together, and together we'll break down this wall.' These numbers impact everything, the video explains: 'The stories we tell, the wages we earn, the future we shape.' For their part, the creators of the video worked with an all-female team: The PSA is completely written, produced, and starred in my women, a fact that the project says underscores 'the wealth of female talent that often goes untapped'.","The PSA spoof highlights a series of shocking statistics about the number of women working within the movie industry .

Samantha Fleming and her newborn daughter Serenity were last seen in Anderson on April 5, when they left with a woman who said she was from Indiana's Department of Child Services, according to police. The three-week-old infant was discovered unharmed at a home in Gary on Friday and will be returned to relatives. Police have discovered a body they believe to be Indiana woman Samantha Fleming (left), who was reported missing with her newborn daughter Serenity (right) weeks ago in a city 180 miles away . In the same home, police found a body doused with bleach, wrapped in plastic and stuffed in a plastic storage bin, according to Lt. Thomas Pawlak. Police were led to Gary after Fleming's cell phone signal was picked up in the city, where the young mother's wallet was also found. Fleming was reported missing by her boyfriend. According to police, Fleming left the home they shared with her daughter Serenity after the woman who claimed to be from Child Protective Services told the new mother she had to appear at a hearing. Police said the woman told Fleming the hearing was at Lake Superior Court in Hammond, which is 13 miles from the home where the body was discovered. The infant was handed over to police by a woman who is believed to be the alleged kidnapper's sister, according to the Chicago Tribune. Police have not released the name of the woman. Pawlak said the woman had arrived at the house of the alleged kidnapper, who was not there, to pick up items for the baby. The house had a nursery. 'It appears that she had been planning this,' Pawlak said. 'There was everything you would buy for a new baby. A crib, changing table, diaper bag, carrier, new clothes.' According to police, the alleged kidnapper had asked her sister to care for the baby she was passing off as her own. That is the same story one neighbor of the woman said she was also told. The body was found on Friday in the 1900 block of Cleveland Street in Gary, Indiana. Police found a nursery inside the home and a neighbor said the owner of the house had said she was pregnant with twins . The neighbor told Chicago Tribune she was friends with the alleged kidnapper, who had told her she was pregnant with twins. The 36-year-old woman then told her neighbor around Easter that one of the twins had died after she had given birth, and that the other child was in the hospital with jaundice. When the neighbor eventually saw the woman with the child, she said she found the baby to be 'lighter-skinned' than she expected. The woman also had a bandage on her hand. The alleged kidnapper asked her neighbor to watch her house because she was going out of town. Just days before the woman left, the neighbor said she saw her going back and forth from her house to garage and carrying small plastic grocery bags. The neighbor said she and her friend had been texting regularly since the woman left. But when she texted the alleged kidnapper after she saw police enter her home on Friday, the messages stopped. The alleged kidnapper was located at a hospital in Texas. Police said she is a person of interest but has not yet been arrested. Pawlak believes the alleged kidnapper was very familiar with Fleming. 'She knew a lot about this mother,' he said. 'Enough to convince her she was with CPS.'","Samantha Fleming and daughter Serenity were last seen in Anderson, Indiana on April 5 .

However, in the wake of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake - which led to a series of avalanches which buried the Everest base camp - the new parents have been eager to get their babies out of Nepal. The parents who were pictured returning to Sde Dov Airport on Monday had traveled abroad before Saturday's disaster to collect their children.

'I'm not sleeping because of the baby - which is a good reason - but I'm also not sleeping because of worries about the building collapsing.'

051db270afc32571a08c15124330efe89d80fea8,"An FBI agent's sniper rifle (similar to the one pictured) was ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot . An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month . Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car.

3d9c0b6d1e1093ef2918ef6c797c7f9b7b821fb5,"Ben Affleck is apologizing after it came to light that the Academy Award-winning actor and director asked that information be withheld from a PBS show about his family history. After appearing on Finding Your Roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner, Affleck pushed the network to leave that information out of the program it was first revealed by DailyMail.com, a request the producers ultimately agreed to. This enabled Affleck to hide the identity of his ancestor, named today by The Sun as James McGuire, who kept eight slaves on his farm in Trenton in New Jersey in the 1840s. Today the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on Facebook, while also explaining his reasons for his decision. Scroll down for video . Ben Affleck has apologized after he demanded information about a slave-owning relative be withheld from a PBS show about his ancestry . Affleck took to Facebook to issue his apology . 'After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for Finding Your Roots, it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves,' wrote Affleck. 'I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.' Affleck went on to say he lobbied for that information to be withheld after filming the episode. 'It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable,' he explained. 'The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family.' He then added; 'I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story. We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing.' US genealogist Debra Fleming is said to have helped trace Affleck's family tree back to McGuire, a relative of his father Timothy. Ms Fleming told the Sun: 'There are lots of farmers in the family. Slavery didn't end in New Jersey until 1846.' Affleck is just one of the many celebrities once again under fire after WikiLeaks sorted all the hacked Sony emails into a system that makes them easier for the public to search. PBS meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network's editorial standards. They have yet to release a statement on their findings. After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for ""Finding Your Roots,"" it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves. I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth. Skip decided what went into the show. I lobbied him the same way I lobby directors about what takes of mine I think they should use. This is the collaborative creative process. Skip agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with. In the end, it's his show and I knew that going in. I'm proud to be his friend and proud to have participated. It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable. The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family. I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story. We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing. I am glad that my story, however indirectly, will contribute to that discussion. While I don't like that the guy is an ancestor, I am happy that aspect of our country's history is being talked about.

But the FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be. Investigators found that a number of flavors were labeled 'healthy' - brimming with fiber, protein and antioxidants, while being low in fat and sodium. However, upon closer inspection, it was found that 'none of the products met the requirements to make such content claims' and were in fact 'misbranded'. Mislabeled? The FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be . Indeed, Daily Mail Online calculated that one KIND bar flavor - not included in the FDA investigation - contains more calories, fat and sodium than a Snickers bar. A 40g Honey Smoked BBQ KIND Bar - marketed as 'bold and all-natural' - contains 230 calories, 16gms of fat and 125mgs of sodium. Meanwhile, an equivalent serving of Snickers contains 190 calories, 9gms of fat and 91mgs of sodium. In response, a spokesperson for KIND highlighted that nuts are to blame for the imbalance. 'Nuts, key ingredients in many of our snacks and one of the things that make fans love our bars, contain nutritious fats that exceed the amount allowed under the FDA’s standard. 'This is similar to other foods that do not meet the standard for use of the term healthy, but are generally considered to be good for you like avocados, salmon and eggs.'. However, New York University nutritionist Marion Nestle told Today.com that said the problem is not nuts and it's the 'hidden' sugary ingredients that have to change. KIND Bar: Honey Smoked BBQ (40g) Calories: 230 . Fat: 16gm . Sodium:125mg . Protein: 10g . Snickers Bar (40g) Calories: 190 . Fat: 9gm . Sodium: 91mg . Protein: 3g . 'KIND bars are candy bars making health claims, and thereby marketing them as healthy snacks,'  Nestle said. The four KIND bars highlighted in the FDA case include the Almond & Apricot, Almond & Coconut, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate  and Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew. On April 14 KIND posted a note on its website stating that it was 'moving quickly to comply' with the FDA's request. 'We're also taking it upon ourselves to conduct a thorough review of all of our snack food labels and website information to ensure that they're compliant,' the message continued. While labeling readjustments will be made to certain bars, KIND reassures fans that recipes will remain the same. It added: 'We couldn’t be more proud of our snack foods and their nutritional benefits. 'Our entire line of delicious snacks made with high quality ingredients like whole grains, nuts and seeds will continue to be available wherever KIND is sold.' KIND bars,  the brainchild of New York salesman Daniel Lubetzky, first hit the market in 2004. The clear-packaged snacks quickly became a hit with consumers and sales soared from $15 million in 2008 to nearly $120 million in 2012, according to Fortune. In a bid to expand into the health food market further, Lubetzky came up with a granola-like cereal called 'healthy grain clusters'.. There's said to be 'a multitude of new recipes' in the pipeline too.","FDA Investigators found that a number of flavors were labeled 'healthy' - brimming with fiber and antioxidants, while being low in fat and sodium .

8f476bbfc120e0ce8c4724e63ab5ba3440b5f7c8,"The devastated fiance of the late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough has written an emotional letter to her followers, revealing she was undergoing radiation treatment in her final weeks and 'giggling and drinking green smoothies' in her hospital bed until the day she died. Ms Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a lengthy fight with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as epithelioid sarcoma. She spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas and does not have scientific support. But after discussions with 'oncologists, healers and specialists around the world', in her final weeks - the most 'difficult' weeks of her fight - Ms Ainscough began a course of targeted radiation, her partner Tallon Pamenter has revealed. 'This was a risky and tough decision, but Jess bravely embraced this last chance option,' he said. Jessica Ainscough (left) was planning to marry her partner Tallon Pamenter this year. She died after a long fight with cancer in February . 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life,' Mr Pamenter said . Tribute: Jessica Ainscough died in late February after a seven-year-long battle with cancer . 'In true wellness warrior style, we integrated our natural healing regime with the recommended radiation. 'Finally the walls were broken down between conventional and unconventional medicine - I don't know why as a society we must choose one or the other. 'This was something Jess was looking forward with sharing (with her followers). It was an exciting evolution from her earlier days of feeling that she had to be part of one extreme world or the other.' Mr Pamenter said the six weeks of her radiation were among the toughest the couple - who were planning to marry this year - had been through. 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included.' The radiation successfully managed to shrink the tumour but 'some complications arose during the final stages of treatment'. 'Not long after, the words I LOVE YOU would leave my lips only to fall softly upon Jess's ears for the last time. 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since.' 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included,' She 'showed (her partner Tallon) what it means to live in a world full of love', he said in his tribute . 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since' 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life. 'I have been taken to a place so foreign and unknown with no navigational bearing on how to get back. 'Loved ones tell me to be strong during this time... but the thing is I don't want to be strong... I want to cry when I'm sad, yell when I'm angry and smile during those fleeting moments of happiness brought on by the memories we created together. 'I want to sit in silence and be present with every single emotion that decides to show up. 'It's in those moments I feel closest to her.' Ms Ainscough made the decision to undergo radiation after the fungating tumour in her left shoulder became large and painful. It began to interfere with her 'ability to enjoy her favourite things like walking our furbabies on the beach', Mr Parmenter said. Mr Pamenter told Daily Mail Australia she planned to tell her followers about her new treatment just days after she passed away. Ms Ainscough was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 when she was 22 and working at Dolly magazine, a favourite of teenage girls. She initially underwent targeted chemotherapy to her left arm, according to reports, but the cancer returned a year later. She also refused doctors' advice to have her left arm amputated. Jessica's mother was also diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by her daughter's fight, she also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. Mr Pamenter said his partner 'showed me what it means to live in a world full of love'. She was laid to rest in early March.","Devastated fiance of late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough writes touching tribute to followers .

The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video . Australian citizen Ibrahim Jalloh (pictured) is reportedly facing drugs charges in Guangzhou province . Peter Gardner (left) and Kalynda Davis (right) were apprehended in Guangzhou. Davis was allowed to go free when charges were withdrawn but Gardner's case has been brought forward by six months . Jockey Anthony Roger Bannister (pictured) was charged with importing 3kg of methamphetamine . The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia. Another citizen, Ibrahim Jalloh and his friend Bengali Sherrif were arrested at Guangzhou Airport in July over alleged drug crimes. Sherrif is reported to have been granted a suspended death sentence and Jalloh has not yet faced trial, according to the ABC. Other names have not been released. Do you know more?

Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister was approached for comment but was unavailable to respond by Daily Mail Australia's deadline.

929791869be6c996e8d9f14626c30f157ed9ed59,"The stage was set for the coronation of King Jimmy on Tuesday but West Indies stubbornly refused to hurry him to his throne. The perfect script for this first Test saw Anderson taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in England’s history in his 100th game with record holder Sir Ian Botham here and waiting to crown his successor. But West Indies made Anderson wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series. Certainly Anderson would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first Test as West Indies did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first. When Anderson, watched by his wife, two daughters and parents, strode out to bat England had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by Ian Bell’s century. But ‘the Burnley Lara’, of course, is a more than useful No 11 these days and came within 19 runs of a Test century at Trent Bridge last year, so it should not have been a surprise to see him sticking around with Chris Jordan. When the pair were separated after a last-wicket stand of 38 England had moved to within a run of the score of 400 that should have been their minimum target when they were well placed on 341 for four on the first evening. Then it was a question of whether this unassuming Lancastrian could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake Botham, who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate, at the top of England’s Test tree. Only it was not quite as simple as that. Modern Test pitches in the Caribbean are notoriously slow and turgid and it was never going to be a case of simply sitting back and waiting for a West Indian collapse. Jimmy Anderson (right) is still three wickets away from breaking Sir Ian Botham's England record . Ben Stokes was England's first man to be dismissed on day two when he edged to Jason Holder in the slips . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Stokes to take West Indies' first wicket of the day in Antigua . James Tredwell edges a delivery from Holder behind as he is dismissed for eight . Anderson had surprisingly chosen to bowl from the Curtly Ambrose End where the strong cross-wind that blows across this ground would in theory assist in-swing more than his more dangerous out-swinger. But Anderson, who had led England out on to the field in his landmark Test, generally knows what he is doing and successfully targeted the outside edge of the left-handed Devon Smith’s bat with a beauty. It was to prove his only success of a frustrating day. Anderson could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other England bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets. Jordan had looked good in making an unbeaten 21 and now he was to again prove himself an all-round cricketer of rich but raw promise, taking the wicket of Darren Bravo and later claiming an outstanding diving slip catch off James Tredwell to send back his old Barbados schoolmate Kraigg Brathwaite. Stuart Broad, who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the World Cup, had earlier ended Marlon Samuels hopes of extending his purple patch against England and West Indies were on the back foot at 99 for four.

Yet the evergreen Shiv Chanderpaul, who could easily have gone to his first ball, settled in to his old idiosyncratic routine and hung on to the close with the far less secure Jermaine Blackwood, who had a major escape when Stokes had him well caught at slip only to be denied because he had over-stepped. Stokes has previous in this regard, having been denied his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide when he snared Brad Haddin only to overstep again and there is simply no excuse to lose a wicket in this way. The Durham hot-head was clearly ticking afterwards and it can only be hoped that he did not encounter any lockers when he returned to the dressing room, having broken his wrist punching one in Barbados last year. West Indies finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving England with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them. West Indies were batting earlier than expected because of a poor performance from England in the morning as they replicated their struggles of the first session of the match and crumbled against good pace bowling. Chris Jordan celebrates after dismissing Darren Bravo, who edged behind to Buttler, for 10 . Broad celebrates dismissing Marlon Samuels for 33 to leave West Indies on 89 for three . Tredwell celebrates after seeing Jordan hold onto a catch at first slip to dismiss Kraigg Brathwaite . Stokes was perfectly placed to score his second Test hundred but once he had steered Jerome Taylor straight to gully England worryingly had no answer to what remains a more than useful West Indies pace trio. Most disturbing of all was the performance of Broad, who was once a good enough batsman to score a Test hundred at Lord’s against Pakistan. Now he looks a shadow of a player once thought of as a potential No 7 for England and again looked like he had been affected by being hit in the face by India’s Varun Aaron at Old Trafford last summer. Broad was honest enough to admit during the World Cup that he had had nightmares about the incident that left his nose broken but he was also confident that he was getting back to his best with the bat. It did not seem that way here as he ducked a couple of short balls from Kemar Roach and then, caught on the back foot, slapped a fuller ball to gully. When he fell and England had slumped to 361 for nine the Test was back in the balance but Anderson and Jordan kept England’s noses in front until the wait for Anderson’s big moment began. We are all still waiting. England, meanwhile, should confirm on Wednesday that Moeen Ali will join the squad in time for the second Test in Grenada after successfully coming through his return after injury with Worcestershire. It could mean that Adil Rashid, disappointing in the warm-up in St Kitts, is released to return to Yorkshire, who have been frustrated by the sight of four of their players being in the England party but not included in this first Test.","West Indies reach 155 for four at stumps on day two of first Test .

dce1580f3a2630564b7cbad90216ed75a00318cf,"Kent Sprouse was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night in Texas. Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. He died 22 minutes after being injected and is now the fifth inmate to be executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . In his final statement shortly before he was killed, Sprouse said; 'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them. 'I would like to apologize to my family for all of the trouble that I have caused them. I would also like to thank my family for all of their support. I guess that’s it.' Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) and customer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said that a recent purchase of pentobarbital meant they had enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","Kent Sprouse, 42, died of a lethal injection Thursday in Texas .

35b061a74f06747135e4447859c4ccd95ba4cb2b,"Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday that he won't sign a religious freedom bill that his state's legislature sent to him on Tuesday, citing influence from his politically liberal son. He is sending it back to lawmakers, he told reporters, for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act – which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians. Hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law. 'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Hutchinson said. 'And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that ... there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.' Seth told Daily Mail Online that 'I love and respect my father very much, but sometimes we have political disagreements, just as many families do.' 'I had communicated with him my opposition to the bill, along with thousands of other Arkansans and concerned citizens around the country,' he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a former member of the US Congress, where he was a reliable conservative vote on social issues – but he said Wednesday that he won't sign a new religious freedom bill into law . LIKE FATHER, LIKE – WHOA! The Republican governor's son Seth, pictured in a Barack Obama shirt, signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law . About 200 demonstrators flooded the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday after the  bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature . 'I’m proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the LGBT community in Arkansas, the state that I love (Go hogs!),' the younger Hutchinson said. Seth works as a labor organizing coordinator for the Austin, Texas flagship office of the Texas State Employees Union. 'Most importantly,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'I hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to HB 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more Americans and help create a long-lasting drive for change in this country, on many issues.' His father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory. 'The bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law,' Hutchinson said. 'It doesn't mirror it in a couple of ways, particularly allowing the First Amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims.' 'Therefore I asked that changes be made in the legislation and I've asked that the leaders in the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended.' The White House jumped into the fray on Wednesday, with spokesman Josh Earnest telling reporters that the Arkansas legislation could 'be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.' 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to,' Earnest said. 'And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.' Hutchinson didn't cite any pressure other than his son's, however. 'My responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions,' Gov. Hutchinson said at the state Capitol, 'and to do what I can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of Arkansas, protects those of religious conscience – but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment.' The unusual move – sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it – means Hutchinson doesn't risk a veto-override in the state legislature. Lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand, or they could do what he asks. Josh Earnest . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on Wednesday: . 'The piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week. 'The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation. 'We saw, you know, some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably – or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love. 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to. And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry. 'But you know, obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine. I think we've made pretty clear what our views are on that.' The governor has one other option: He said he's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that 'Arkansas wants to be a place of tolerance.' His concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in Indiana, where a similar law took effect on Monday. One key detail in Indiana's version – and Arkansas' – expands the idea of giving conscientious Christians a way to defend themselves if they're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings. They protect against civil suits filed by private individuals, not just those pursued by the government. But few civil-rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people. State- and federal-level commissions and law-enforcement agencies typically carry them forward. And Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws have not 'been a sort of blank check to discriminate.' At issue is whether a Christian-owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values. Typically, the issue is raised when same-sex couples seek vendors for their weddings. 'Let me make it clear,' Hutchinson said Wednesday: 'This law under consideration does not extend discrimination. That's important.' 'What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,' he said. 'And secondly, we make sure that we communicate we're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.' At the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious-express rights of business owners. 'This bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance' between those rights and those of gay men and women, he said. Hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on Tuesday his office said he planned to sign it. 'This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times,' he said Wednesday as Americans watched his quick 180-degree turn. Hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday, saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 . DAD-WHISPERER: Seth Hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad . As Arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious-freedom ground zero, Wal-Mart, the state's largest for-profit employer, had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea. Those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big-box chain is seen as a rare bastion of Christian values in a crowded secular marketplace. The Walton family, the company founders who still own a large stake, are famous for using leadership models culled from Christian service traditions. Wal-Mart also is known for selling enough Christian-themed books to worry some religious bookstores. Yet Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, signed a statement saying that the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act 'threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.' 'Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,' McMillon said. Arkansas legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on Tuesday. A similar measure that Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate. It took Pence less than a day to capitulate to protesters, saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to 'fix' the law's language. FLASHPOINT: Rallies like this one in Arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are already on the books . Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger (right) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed, but now his brainchild is in limbo . 'WE WILL FIX THIS': Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told reporters on Tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination . Wal-Mart isn't the only big player that would have complained if Hutchinson had signed the bill. NASCAR said in a statement Tuesday that it was 'disappointed' by Indiana's legislation, and would likely pile on in the Razorback State. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events including this week's Final Four men's basketball tournament. The governors of New York, Vermont, Washington and Connecticut have announced bans on certain state-funded travel to Indiana. Mayors of Denver, Seattle and Washington, D.C. have followed suit for city-funded travel. Those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include Arkansas. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the Indiana law 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the Arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the Obama administration.","'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Republican Gov.

Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, . Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to . an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of . Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the . theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart . Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video . Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 . A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist . This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught . 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they . think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are . threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the . Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and . threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black. Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined . to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, . 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the . museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair . allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs . in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on . the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum . The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces . Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an Édouard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . FBI investigators have long said they believed organized . crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed . a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked . if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court . testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the . stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police . uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s.

95a942ed60852ec257f145d8bafd0206295dab7b,"A large gas pipeline exploded into a tower of fire on Friday in Central California, closing both directions of a major highway and injuring at least 15 people, four of them critically, authorities said. It was not clear what caused the explosion at the Fresno County Sheriff's gun range that brought traffic in the area to a halt. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road alongside Highway 99, according to Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. Scroll down for video . A fireball erupts after a large gas pipeline exploded in Fresno, California, on Friday. The explosion and fire closed both directions of Highway 99, authorities said . A firefighter watches the blaze shot well over 100 feet into the air. Eleven people were injured, three critically, in the explosion . The flames shot well over 100 feet into the air, witnesses said. Traffic heading north and south on Highway 99 in Fresno was halted by the explosion about 2.30pm as flames towered over the roadway, the California Highway Patrol reported. The highway was reopened three hours later, the CHP said. The driver of the front-loader was a county public works employee who had been working at the shooting range all day working on a tall berm that confines gunfire to the range, Mims said. Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast. Four patients were being treated at Community Regional Medical Center's burn and trauma unit, spokeswoman Mary Lisa Russell said. Three of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened at the gun range while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road, according to authorities . Pacific Gas & Electric crews are seen in the distance along the Fresno road after the massive explosion . Four other patients were taken to St. Agnes Hospital and three more to Madera Community Hospital. Asked whether the driver was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded, Mims said her office is investigating. 'Hopefully we'll be able to speak to the worker to see what action he was taking at the time,' she said. Mims noted PG&E had, some time ago, marked the location of gas lines in the construction zones. The flames prompted a two-alarm call of firefighters, said Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department. A nearby rail line was also halted out of concern that a passing train could spark leaking gas. Kevin Ling was driving by shortly after the blast, and he saw fire flying into the sky. 'As I got closer, the flames were just bigger and bigger,' he said. 'It was shooting up to 200 feet or more, and a fireball maybe ten-to-15 feet in diameter. It was like out of a movie.' 'My window was up and my AC was on and it still felt like a furnace inside my car,' he added. Emergency respondents gather near the scene of a gas line rupture. Those who were injured were taken to several different hospitals in the area . Highway 99, a major highway in central California, was closed in both directions after the gas-line explosion . The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Martinez said. A front-loader was in the area, but it's unclear if the vehicle was digging at the time of the explosion, he said, adding that 'it was a large explosion that shook the surrounding area'. PG&E spokesman Denny Boyles said the pipeline was damaged by a vehicle and that the line was buried but he didn't know how deeply. The flame from the pipe was extinguished at about an hour and a half after the blast, he said. Another PG&E spokesman, Keith Stephens, referred questions to local authorities. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are reported to be injured,' he said. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office is investigation as to whether the driver of a front-loader doing work in the area was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded . The California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement that it is investigating the explosion in cooperation with the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. PG&E's natural-gas operations have been under scrutiny following a fiery 2010 PG&E pipeline blast that killed eight people in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno. National Transportation Safety Board investigators blamed faulty safety practices by PG&E, and lax oversight by state regulators, for the 2010 blast. Earlier this month, state regulators leveled the state's biggest-ever penalty against a utility - $1.6billion - against PG&E for the San Bruno blast. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker said at the time that continuing safety citations against the utility made him doubt that the utility had embraced a culture of safety, and he raised the possibility of breaking apart the utility's gas and electric operations. The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department, said . Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said.

93c1f2e19b66d2c7409aeb7aeb1b03e1f9f3c241,"A federal judge has ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status. The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . F.U.I.R.S.: American conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the IRS confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names . Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal, ran the 'Exempt Organizations' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits; the Justice Department said this week that it won't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions . Tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office, but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy, the Obamacare insurance overhaul, the environment or foreign policy. Dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the IRS violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, along with a section of federal law – Section 6103 of Title 26 – that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns. When the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General investigated the IRS's actions, it demanded – and received – a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up. It's this list that the tea party groups want. Their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of 'all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the IRS from January 20, 2009, through July 15, 2013.' Dlott could then choose to certify that list as a 'class' of plaintiffs. IRS commissioner John Koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny, and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget – but some organizations are holdout out, claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit . The IRS's lawyers claimed that they couldn't provide the court with the names of all the groups, saying they would have to turn over the very documents that Section 6103 requires them to keep confidential. The conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the IRS. Dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over. 'The Court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding,' her ruling reads.

Dlott also ordered the IRS to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic, The Washington Times reported. Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago, was facing the possibility of criminal Contempt of Congress charges until the Obama administration's Department of Justice declined on Monday to prosecute her. Lerner, under subpoena in May 2013, delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions.","Right-wing groups want court to let them sue the IRS in a class-action lawsuit for violating their constitutional right to equal treatment .

8207f0436998bb53de0562cc1e6e205b079505fc,"Bill and Hillary Clinton spent $104,000 in taxpayer money on hotel rooms for Secret Service agents when they vacationed in the Dominican Republic over the New Year's holiday. A Dominican news report says the power couple spent part of their trip staying with sugar barons Alfy and Pepe Fanjul at Casa de Campo, a private Dominican resort they own. The news outlet Listin Diario reported on January 2 that Fanjul and the Clintons discussed Hillary's presidential ambitions during the visit. Casa de Campo, a luxurious retreat for the world's super wealthy elites, is also at the center of criminal allegations now dogging a Democratic U.S. senator. LAP OF LUXURY: The Casa de Campo resort services the upper crust of America's '1 per cent' super-rich, and both Sen. Bob Menendez and Bill and Hillary Clinton have holidayed there . SAME OLD BILL: This Instagram pic, deleted from a user's account on Thursday, shows former President Clinton cavorting among yougn socialites at Casa de Campo . INDICTED: NEw Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez (left) and his wealthy donor Dr. Salomon Melgen (right) are both accused of multiple federal crimes including bribery and honest services fraud . Federal prosecutors charged New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez with corruption on Wednesday in a 14-count indictment. He is accused of accepting money and trips from wealthy donor Dr Salomon Melgen in exchange for the influence of his office. Melgen flew Menendez and his guests on a private jet to stay at his Casa de Campo villa multiple times, free of charge, prosecutors say. The doctor is also now under federal indictment, accused of bribing Menendez with gifts and approximately $700,000 in political contributions. In exchange, the government says, Menendez helped Melgen's three girlfriends get travel visas to enter the U.S., interceded with Medicare authorities when he was accused of billing fraud, and helped lay the groundwork for a Melgen-controlled company to win a lucrative port security contract in the Dominican Republic. PRIVATE VILLAS: Melgen owns a house at Casa de Campo where he entertained Menendez on several occasions at his own expense . SUGAR BARONS: Pepe Fanjul (left) and Alfy Fanjul (right) own a congromerate that includes Domino Sugar and Florida Crystals, and they also own Casa de Campo. The brothers entertained the Clintons there in early January . Melgen's 70-year-old former secretary told The Miami Herald in 2013 that Melgen had also hosted Bill Clinton at his resort home in the past. And Melgen has contributed $8,600 to Hillary Clinton's campaigns for the U.S. Senate and the White House, according to public records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The Weekly Standard reported on Thursday that the Clintons spent the first part of their Dominican holiday three months ago at Punta Cana, a different resort area. They 'chose to spend their end-of-year vacation in the Dominican Republic's tourist hub Punta Cana,' according to Listin Diario, but on January 2 'shifted to the tourist center Casa de Campo' where they stayed with the Fanjuls. A federal government spending report describes $104,093 in payments for Secret Service lodging, but doesn't specify whether it covered rooms in one or two resort areas. FACING THE MUSIC: Dr. Melgen was in Newark, New Jersey on Thursday to face a judge for his criminal arraignment in the Senator Bob Menendez corruption case . ONE-PERCENTERS: Melgen and Fanjul have houses like this one at Casa de Campo; Bill Clinton has stayed with both of them . Bill and Hillary Clinton were photographed at both resorts. The former president attended 'private dinners with friends at their Casa de Campo villas' and played golf, according to Casa de Campo Living. Alfy Fanjul also played a small part in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that dogged Clinton's 1990s presidency and resulted in his impeachment. Lewinsky told Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr that on Presidents' Day in 1996, as Clinton was trying to break off their covert romance, Fanjul called the Oval Office. Confirmation of that phone call in White House records was one important detail that lent credibility to Lewinsky's claims that she had engaged in a series of intimate moments in the White House with the leader of the free world. WELCOME TO THE D.R.: Hillary and Bill Clinton stayed in the eastern Domonican Republic resort town of Punta Cana before shifting the vacation to Casa de Campo days later . FORE! The former president was photographed playing golf both at Punta Cana (shown) and at Casa de Campo . Security at Casa de Campo keeps out the general public. The only way onto the property for non-residents is to have a reservation at the hotel or at a home on the property. Casa de Campo itself is in La Romana province, on the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The Fanjuls own the sprawling 11-square-mile resort, along with the airport that services it. It's a luxury golf and sporting resort, according to the Menendez indictment, with a marina, three golf courses, three polo fields, equestrian facilities, a 245-acre shooting facility, spa, beaches and a hotel where rooms typically cost about $500 a night.","Clintons' New Year's vacation included stay at Casa de Campo, where Sen.

787016c8e76b8e3fbf63d5e7356d86e4a0e2bc9c,"A former elementary school teacher who police say was obsessed with one of her 11-year-old students has waived a preliminary hearing on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's legal custody. Geraldine Alcorn, 29, of Pittsburgh, and her attorney declined to comment as they walked from a city magistrate's courtroom Wednesday. In exchange for the waiver — which means Alcorn must now stand trial on the charge or take some kind of plea bargain — Allegheny County prosecutors dropped two other misdemeanors she faced: luring a child into a vehicle and corruption of minors. Leaving court: Geraldine Alcorn, left, leaves court on Wednesday April 1, 2015, in Pittsburgh after waiving a preliminary hearing on  Wednesday on a felony charge that she interfered with the girl's custody . Geraldine Alcorn, pictured walking to court on Wednesday, allegedly encrypted her phone number on the girl's math homework, exchanged thousands of text messages with her and even spoke of adopting her . Obsessed teacher: Geraldine Alcorn, 28, faces multiple charges for 'obsessively' texting an 11-year-old student . Prosecutors, who also declined to comment, allege Alcorn encrypted her phone number on the girl's math homework, exchanged thousands of text messages with her and even talked of adopting and running away with the girl before Alcorn resigned last month. The girl's mother, a single parent, complained to school officials after finding out Alcorn had visited the girl at their home while the mother was working. The mother then found stickers and letters from Alcorn in the girl's school binder, plus two letters the girl wrote to Alcorn with three headings: 'Things Ms. Alcorn and I can do,' ''what we can do,' and 'when we can do it,' the criminal complaint said. The girl told police she and Alcorn kept their relationship secret and, among other things, Alcorn discussed adopting the girl or taking her from her home. Alcorn had told the girl that 'they would be on the run for a while,' if Alcorn followed through on that, police said. Alcorn is not believed to have sexual feelings for the girl but allegedly told police of a 'deep love' she has for her. Pittsburgh Public Schools officials learned Feb. 13 that 'a teacher had developed an improper attachment' with a student at Pittsburgh Beechwood, a pre-K-5 school. Alcorn resigned March 2. Police said she tried to contact the girl on March 13, a Friday, when Alcorn returned to gather her personal belongings. The following Monday, police said, the girl found 'gifts and several letters, some encrypted, in her locker and desk,' according to the criminal complaint. 'The letters, written by Alcorn, instructed the 11-year-old female to contact her.' Alcorn hid her phone number on a math worksheet by telling the girl to dial numbers that had been circled, police said.

65e6c2595de97e78758cd753a3b3054293dbf117,"A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.","Andrew Steele, 40, claims that the terminal disease affected his brain .

Both armored vehicles have raised roofs, deep-tinted windows and New York license plates.

Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday . It’s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan . Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate’s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell.

Nine months after Smith received a one-week suspension for claiming women can play a role in provoking men into violence, Smith tried to to claim that boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr's career should be looked at separate from his domestic violence history.

0b025fc57380060743ffa17399995da1569a614e,"A mentally disabled Colorado man was sentenced to 100 years in prison Friday for the murder of a Montana teacher whose death highlighted the downsides of an oil boom that's sweeping across the remote Northern Plains, bringing thousands of newcomers to the area. Michael Keith Spell, 25, of Parachute, Colorado, was sentenced following a hearing before state District Judge Richard Simonton in Sidney. Spell pleaded guilty in October to killing Sherry Arnold, 43, after attempting to abduct the popular math teacher as she was jogging near her home in 2012. Arnold's body was found months later buried in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. Co-defendant Lester Van Waters Jr. was sentenced in December to 80 years in prison on a charge of deliberate homicide by accountability. Sentenced to die behind bars: Michael Keith Spell, 25, sits in state District Court in Sidney, Mont, Friday April 17, 2015, before being sentenced to 100 years prison for the 2012 murder of a 43-year-old teacher in the booming Bakken oil patch of Montana . Murdered at random: Sherry Arnold, a popular maths teacher from the small town of Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7 when she disappeared. She was pulled into a car by Spell and his friend, strangled to death, and then buried 50 miles away in North Dakota . Defense attorneys had asked that Spell be placed into custody of state health officials for placement in an institution for the mentally disabled. They claimed he was 'easily confused and displays the intelligence of an 11-year-old'. They said Spell's mental problems made him unable to conform to the law, making him eligible for commitment to the Montana Department of Health and Human Services. In the days before Arnold's killing, Spell and Waters traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and the men's previous testimony. The defendants came to the region looking for work in the booming Bakken oil patch. During their trip, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack ""brought the devil out in him"" and began talking about kidnapping and killing a woman, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. Spell's attorneys alleged Waters threatened to kill Spell with a utility razor unless he went along with the kidnapping plan. After the pair spotted Arnold along a Sidney street, Spell tried to grab her, leading to a struggle in which Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated, authorities said. Co-accused: Lester Van Waters (left) was sentenced to 80 years in December.  He and Spell (right-in 2012) were under the influence of crack cocaine when they kidnapped and murder Mrs Arnold . Killed: Michael Spell told investigators he pulled Sherry Arnold into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston . Spell said during an October change-of-plea hearing that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold. Arnold's body was found months after her disappearance in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. For Sidney residents, Arnold's death offered a horrifying illustration of the social upheaval caused by an energy boom that has turned the once-sleepy town into an oil patch hub. Crime has spiked in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota over the past several years as traffickers of methamphetamine and other drugs seek to profit off oil workers flush with cash, according to law enforcement officials. Spell was spared a potential death sentence after state health officials agreed with the defense that he was mentally disabled. Guilty: In this February 2012 photo, Michael Keith Spell, appears at a hearing in the Williams County Courthouse in Williston. Defense attorneys wanted Spell sentenced to an institution for the mentally disabled . Dearly missed: Rhonda Whited-Rupp holds a picture of her sister, Sherry Arnold, seen in a cowboy hat, and Arnold's family. Michael Keith Spell was sentenced to 100 years prison Friday for the murder of Mrs Arnold . But Simonton in May rejected arguments from the defense that Spell's history of low IQ scores, his difficulty reading and other mental problems rendered him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors recommended 100 years in prison and thus became Spell's sentence Friday. Defense attorneys Al Avignone and Lisa Banick said Friday's judgment will be appealed based on their continued belief that he was not fit for trial. If the state Supreme Court agrees, Spell would be committed to a state mental institution, Avignone said.","Sherry Arnold, a 44-year-old math teacher from Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7, 2012, when she was abducted .

91e48c9aa24d9867dc5f40cfbe6a936929855859,"Caretakers of Abraham Lincoln's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering critique in National Geographic magazine and looming budget cuts that could threaten management of the historic site, even as they commemorate the 150th anniversary of the U.S. Civil War president's assassination. For the state that calls itself the 'Land of Lincoln,' the timing of a ceremony Wednesday in Springfield to mark his death is awkward because Illinois faces a financial crisis and Gov. Bruce Rauner has proposed eliminating the state Historic Preservation Agency that manages sites including the tomb as it currently exists. He would roll the agency into another department. What's more, the popular tourist site was pilloried in this month's issue of National Geographic magazine as having 'all the historical character of an office lobby.' Landmark: In this Feb. 12, 2015 file photo, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner participates in ceremonies honoring President Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln tomb in Springfield, Illinois . Leader: A marker is seen over the burial site of Abraham Lincoln inside Lincoln's tomb within Oak Ridge Cemetery (November 2013 file photo) Killing: President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at a performance of the play 'Our American Cousin' in April 1865 . Recounting the route of Lincoln's funeral train to Springfield for burial, historian Adam Goodheart describes the tomb as 'a disappointment' and reconstructed in 'incongruous Art Deco style.' 'It's strange to think that there is a place where Lincoln still physically exists in the world, let alone that it's a place like this,' writes Goodheart, who is director for Washington College's Center for the American Experience in Maryland. Goodheart's publicist didn't immediately return a request for comment. The hours and days the Lincoln tomb is open have been reduced, and it's staffed with fewer employees since state lawmakers last year cut $1.1 million funding for sites in the Springfield area. On Tuesday — the 150th anniversary of John Wilkes Booth's shooting of Lincoln, although the president was pronounced dead the following day — Joan Boatz and a group of former bridge club friends found the tomb's iron door locked, despite a sign saying the site should be open at that time. Chris Wills, spokesman for the Historic Preservation Agency, said the correct times when the site is open are posted on its website. Pam VanAlstine, president of the Lincoln Monument Association, said she's deeply concerned about what more cuts might mean for the Lincoln site. 'We're all scared to death,' said VanAlstine, who also serves as a volunteer tour guide. 'We don't know how things are going to be run.' She and other supporters of how Lincoln's final resting place is presented to the public said the National Geographic portrayal was unfair. Remembered: Tourists walk out of Abraham Lincoln's tomb and past a bust of Lincoln statue (November 2013 file photo) Shrouded in history: Caretakers of Abraham Lincoln's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering critique in National Geographic magazine and looming budget cuts that could threaten management of the historic site (February 2014 file photo) 'The author of the piece is certainly entitled to feel underwhelmed by the tomb's interior, but I think it's safe to say he's in the minority,' Wills said. According to the State Historic Preservation Agency, the tomb and its receiving vault have seen more than $2.5 million in recent repairs and renovations, leaving it in what Wills describes as 'excellent physical condition.' The tomb's interior plaster and paint, and bronze and marble construction were renovated last year, and its interior lighting was upgraded for approximately $730,000. The state is currently working on waterproofing the receiving vault, repairing the stone structure's interior, and landscaping to direct water away from the vault, a roughly $390,000 project. Lincoln's tomb was designed by Vermont sculptor Larkin Mead, who won a national contest. It was dedicated by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1874. Originally built on what historians describe as an 'inadequate foundation,' it was reconstructed first in 1899, and then again in 1930 to give the public access to the interior burial chamber. Today, the tomb, a circular structure topped with an obelisk, has its interior sheathed in alternating black and tan marble and is trimmed with bronze. Hallways stretch on either side of a rotunda to the family burial chamber, where Lincoln lies below an inscription 'Now He belongs to the ages.' William Sparks, a visitor to the outside of the tomb Tuesday who took an Amtrak train from Green Bay, Wisconsin, said he had a copy of the National Geographic story with him at his Springfield hotel, but disagreed with its conclusion. 'It's absolutely gorgeous,' he said of the site, even though he didn't get to see the interior of the tomb. 'I don't get (the author's take) at all. This is very impressive.'

On the night he launched his first app, a homeless man predicted that his life was going to change. 'I can work at Google, I can work at SpaceX,' Leo Grand gleefully stated minutes after his carpooling app Trees for Cars went live. 'This will change my life in a magnificent way.' It's been a year and a half since that moment led to Grand and his mentor, Patrick McConlogue, becoming media sensations. But Trees for Cars is no longer available, and Grand is still homeless, Mashable reported. In August 2013 McConlogue offered Grand, the homeless man he saw every day on his walk to work in New York City, a deal: He would either give him $100, or he would teach him how to code. Grand realized he could go through '$100 in a few days' and instead jumped at the opportunity to learn something new that he could then 'turn into something more,' he told Business Insider in 2013. McConlogue provided Grand with daily lessons, as well as a laptop, wireless hot spot, coding books, a solar charger and office space at the start-up where he worked once it got too cold to type outside. Grand, who once said he wasn't 'the average homeless person' and that he considered himself 'eco-friendly', came up with an app designed to get more cars off the road. 'When I first launched my app it was good,' Grand told Mashable this week. 'I was excited, the press was excited, it was just a great moment.' Grand and McConlogue appeared on TV shows, and he says people loved him everywhere and gave him free coffee at restaurants. Being on NBC, he said, was the highlight of his year. 'We got to stay in a nice hotel at Rockefeller Plaza. A nice, swanky hotel. We got the red carpet rolled out in front of us!' he said. But Grand is still living on the streets, and he said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless. Grand created Trees and Cars after Patrick McConlogue offered him a deal: $100 in cash on the spot or daily coding lessons. Grand picked the latter, and was also provided a laptop, office space and coding books . But Grand is still living on the streets. He said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless . Trees for Cars only made Grand between $10,000 to 15,000 dollars, he said. And McConlogue has since taken a job in San Francisco, although he still meets up with Grand every time he's back in New York. The app is no longer in online stores because Grand does not want to pay for its server space. Grand instead uses the money he made from the app to pay for his storage space. He also keeps some possessions in a shopping cart. He insists that he likes living outdoors, although he said he plans to move into an apartment after he makes his second app. Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have made a different app the first time around. 'I would've probably come up with a better idea for a mobile application that can generate a ton of revenue,' he told Mashable. For now, Grand said he does not code everyday anymore. He said 'life' is the reason for that. 'I've got the books, I've got the laptop, I've got the office space. I just haven't been able to get over there recently.' Grand, who gets by with welding jobs and worked for MetLife until he lost his job in 2011, once said the most hurtful thing someone could say to him was that he was dumb or not intelligent. 'Homelessness is not a feature of someone or a condition,' McConlogue said. 'It is something that people put a lot of people - in a lot of different situations - into one giant box.' Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have 'come up with a better ideal' that would have generated more revenue. He said he only made around $10-15,000 with Trees for Cars .","Leo Grand was offered a deal: either $100 or lessons in coding from Patrick McConlogue, who passed him on the street every day .

The eight-week-old Labradors were found near a Tennessee Goodwill donation site on April 18 without any food or water inside of the box where temperatures were reportedly over 100 degrees. The puppies have worms and are malnourished, and it is likely they have lived their entire lives in a cage, according to McKamey Animal Center where the dogs are being treated. Scroll down for video . Three eight-week old puppies (above) were found inside of a sealed cardboard box on April 18 . The Labradors were found by a woman who said the dogs were covered in urine and suffering from heat exhaustion when they were discovered in the box labeled 'stuff animals' The animals have been named Greta Garbo, Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe, and have been flourishing since they began treatment, according to ABC. The good Samaritan, who has not been identified, was driving by and saw the box moving when she approached it tearing a hole into the top finding the dogs. 'She said when she opened the box, she could feel the heat come out. They had been there for a while,' Chelsea Fogal, veterinarian at McKamey Animal Center told WTVC. 'It is frustrating when you have someone do something so neglectful and inhumane,' she added. 'But I think these guys really lucked out that someone, a Good Samaritan, came along and found them. 'I think the outcome could have been a lot worse.' The woman then took the puppies to the animal center for treatment. On Facebook, McKamey wrote that the box was securely taped to prevent their escape. McKamey Animal Center in Tennessee, where the dogs have been receiving treatment, said they have worms and are malnourished, and it is likely they have lived their entire lives in a cage . On Facebook, the animal center said the puppies appear to have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition . 'There was no air ventilation for the puppies and they were covered in urine and suffered from heat exhaustion--the temperature in the box was estimated to be well over 100 degrees,' the center wrote. 'The box had been left at a Goodwill drop off site near HWY 58. The dogs were over heated and covered in urine from a long period of time being inside the box. 'All three dogs are being treated at McKamey Animal Center. 'It would appear they have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition.' Once the puppies complete their treatment at the center, they will be put up for adoption . An animal service officer investigating the case said they have dozens of leads regarding the incident . The puppies will be put up for adoption once they finish being treated at the center. The McKamey is offering a $200 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for the incident. Chattanooga Goodwill Industries is grateful for the quick thinking and reaction of the woman who noticed and rescued the three puppies that were left on the sidewalk near the vicinity of one of its donation center trailers, a representative of the company said in a statement to ABC.

63c81e1dfdf33d73c1d00b2e3397cdd46d7b3fa9,"A lawsuit filed by former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford attempting to have a judge order her kids to return to the U.S. from their father's custody in France has been dismissed once and for all. The case was dismissed with a court order stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids, son Hermes, 8, and daughter Helena, 5, to come back to the United States. Rutherford, 46, claims her children were illegally deported to France when a California Court awarded custody to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch, 40, and she pleaded for the order to be reversed. Scroll down for video . Kelly Rutherford, pictured with her children, Hermes and Helena, during a party in the Hamptons in August 2013, was shut down by the courts again in a final plea to gain custody of her children . Rutherford's lawsuit stating that her children were illegally deported from the United States was dismissed once and for all by a New York court . She claimed that no other U.S. court has ordered children to live in another country when they have an able parent in the United States. Giersch, who is a German citizen residing in France, was deported from the U.S. over allegations of visa fraud. But the dismissal of her case states that Rutherford failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in her custody dispute with Giersch. 'Petitioners allege that the California state court's custody order had the effect of deporting the children in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to remain in the United States,' the document reads. The document added: 'There is no authority establishing the unconditional right of minor children to reside in the United States when one of their custodial parents lives abroad. 'Likewise there is no ""plainly defined and peremptory duty"" requiring Respondents to interfere with the custody order - nor is there, as Petitioners contend, a general affirmative duty on federal agencies requiring them to intervene against what is claimed to be unconstitutional state action.' After divorcing in 2010, Rutherford and ex-husband Daniel Giersch went through a nasty custody battle which ended with Giersch being awarded custody while the children were to visit Rutherford on vacations . Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 . Further, the court states 'the children have not been deported; they retain their United States citizenship and, once they reach the age of majority, they will be free to choose where to reside. 'There is, therefore, no non-frivolous constitutional question, only an attempt to seek federal judicial intervention in a state court custody dispute' The order affirmed the original order and said it would be improper for the federal court to intervene in Rutherford's custody battle. Because of this, there will be no intervention and the appeal will be dismissed. A California court ruled two years ago that the children should live in France with ex-husband Daniel Griesch, who she divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage. Rutherford has said that the court in Monaco, where Giersch lives, decided on a new custody order that lets her only see her children on holiday and during the summer. It has left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $2million in debt after spending all her earnings from Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children. In it's dismissal of her case, the court said it failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in the custody dispute . Daily Mail Online revealed in August that Rutherford had filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of herself and her children. She sued the U.S. government, including Attorney General Holder and Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues. She wanted the US District Court in New York court to grant her ‘temporary emergency authority’ over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was ‘unconstitutional’. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said on November 24 that Rutherford's case was nothing more than her being dissatisfied with the result of the child-custody proceeding. The departments demanded on that her appeal be dismissed and said she's forcing the departments to become part of something they were never involved in. Rutherford argued her case in a New York court on March 18, but the appeal court shut down her plea and ordered the original order to remain in place.","She claims a California judge deported her children illegally in 2012 .

dec80990f4bbfa114ed483c979c5d6a632e17967,"As California struggles with a devastating drought, huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta — and the prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations. A state investigation was launched following complaints from two large agencies that supply water to arid farmland in the Central Valley and to millions of residents as far south as San Diego. Delta farmers don't deny using as much water as they need. But they say they're not stealing it because their history of living at the water's edge gives them that right. Still, they have been asked to report how much water they're pumping and to prove their legal rights to it. Scroll down for video . Drought: In this photo taken Friday March 27, 2015, low-flow water emitter sits on some of the dry, cracked ground of farmer Rudy Mussi's  almond orchard in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta near Stockton, California . Resources: Rudy Mussi watches his grandson, Lorenzo, 20 months, tries to turn a water valve on his almond orchard  in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (March 2015 file photo) At issue is California's century-old water rights system that has been based on self-reporting and little oversight, historically giving senior water rights holders the ability to use as much water as they need, even in drought. Gov. Jerry Brown has said that if drought continues this system built into California's legal framework will probably need to be examined. Delta farmer Rudy Mussi says he has senior water rights, putting him in line ahead of those with lower ranking, or junior, water rights. 'If there's surplus water, hey, I don't mind sharing it,' Mussi said. 'I don't want anybody with junior water rights leapfrogging my senior water rights just because they have more money and more political clout.' The fight pitting farmer against farmer is playing out in the Delta, the hub of the state's water system. With no indication of the drought easing, heightened attention is being placed on dwindling water throughout the state, which produces nearly half of the fruits, nuts and vegetables grown in the U.S. A large inland estuary east of San Francisco, the Delta is fed by rivers of freshwater flowing down from the Sierra Nevada and northern mountain ranges. Located at sea level, it consists of large tracts of farmland separated by rivers that are subject to tidal ebbs and flows. Most of the freshwater washes out to the Pacific Ocean through the San Francisco Bay. Some is pumped — or diverted — by Delta farmers to irrigate their crops, and some is sent south though canals to Central Valley farmers and to 25 million people statewide. The drought now in its fourth year has put Delta water under close scrutiny. Twice last year state officials feared salty bay water was backing up into the Delta, threatening water quality. There was not enough fresh water to keep out saltwater. Mussi, a second-generation Delta farmer, said Central Valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater . In June, the state released water stored for farmers and communities from Lake Oroville to combat the saltwater intrusion. Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources, said 'thousands of acre-feet of water a day for a couple of weeks' were released into the Delta. An acre-foot is roughly enough water to supply a household of four for a year. The fact that the state had to resort to using so much from storage raised questions about where the water was going. That in turn prompted a joint letter by the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation calling for an investigation into how much water Delta farmers are taking — and whether the amount exceeds their rights to it. 'We don't know if there were illegal diversions going on at this time,' said Vogel, leaving it up to officials at the State Water Resources Control Board to determine. 'Right now, a large information gap exists.' Some 450 farmers who hold 1,061 water rights in the Delta and the Sacramento and San Joaquin river watersheds were told to report their water diversions, and Katherine Mrowka, state water board enforcement manager, said a vast majority responded. State officials are sorting through the information that will help them determine whether any are exceeding their water rights and who should be subject to restrictions. 'In this drought period, water accounting is more important to ensure that the water is being used for its intended purpose,' said U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spokesman Louis Moore. Mussi, a second-generation Delta farmer whose family grows tomatoes, wheat, corn, grapes and almonds on 4,500 acres west of Stockton, said Central Valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater. 'All of a sudden they're trying to turn their water into a permanent system and ours temporary,' Mussi said. 'It's just not going to work.' Shawn Coburn farms 1,500 acres along the San Joaquin River in Firebaugh about 100 miles south of the Delta. As a senior rights holder, he figures he will receive 45 percent or less of the water he expected from the federal water project. On another 1,500 acres where he is a junior water rights holder, he will receive no surface water for a second consecutive year. 'I don't like to pick on other farmers, even if it wasn't a drought year,' said Coburn. 'The only difference is I don't have a pipe in the Delta I can suck willy-nilly whenever I want.'","As California struggles with a devastating drought, huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta .

a5f1e1a538f5a90653811eab4fce66d438361162,"It is the age old debate but with a modern twist: which Premier League club is the most popular according to Twitter followers. For the first time ever, fans can see a detailed breakdown of how support for every club varies around the world and in the UK supporters can go as in-depth as seeing the three most popular teams in their local constituency. So, what exactly does the data show? The map was created by looking at the official Twitter accounts for each team, using their followers as an indicator of allegiance. Fans can toggle the map to view their club's support worldwide, see the most popular clubs globally and compare their club with a rival. Using the 'Zoom to' function fans can also look at any country around the world. Liverpool may be struggling in the Premier League and looking at a 2015-16 campaign without Champions League football, but in terms of Twitter followers they dominate the UK. Arsenal have strong support in London and the south east and actually have more followers in the backyards of rivals Chelsea and Tottenham. In Manchester, it is a win for Louis van Gaal's United who dominate the area apart from Gorton where rivals City are more popular. United also have pockets of concentrated support across the UK. Chelsea have strong support in the Western Isles, while clubs such as Newcastle, Sunderland, Hull City, Burnley, Stoke City, Leicester City, Aston Villa, Swansea and Southampton dominate their local areas. But while Liverpool completely dominate the UK market, their global appeal is less impressive. Brendan Rodgers' side have a large following across the world with strong support in Thailand, Norway, Iceland, Uruguay and Australia but find themselves playing second fiddle to the Premier League's other giants in other areas. For instance, the rest of Asia apart from Thailand is dominated by Manchester United - who have strong followings in India and Pakistan and edge out Chelsea in Malaysia and Indonesia, too. While in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines it is Arsenal who come out on top. The UK (left) is dominated by Liverpool green while South America (right) is very much a strong hold of Chelsea . London and the south east is a sea of yellow reflecting Arsenal's domination, with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Liverpool (green) North America is somewhat surprisingly dominated by Arsenal (yellow) with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Man United (red) Eden Hazard (left) and Ramires (right) in action for Chelsea against a MLS All-Star team during the club's 2012 tour of America . Somewhat surprisingly, United are only the third best supported team in America - despite touring the states frequently over the years and having American owners. Chelsea beat Van Gaal's side to second but it is Arsenal - whose largest shareholder is American Stan Kroenke - who dominate across the pond. Arsenal and Chelsea also split Europe, with Arsene Wenger's side most popular in northern European countries such as France, Germany and Poland and Chelsea taking the south. Arsenal are also well supported in northern Africa (Algeria and Morocco) but further south United turn South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe red. Across the globe, Arsenal are the most popular team with 5.6million followers, followed by Chelsea (5.4m) and Manchester United (4.8m). The reasons behind support for a club in any country or area are of course complicated, but certain trends can be explained. For instance, there is often huge support in certain countries for national heroes. Ivory Coast is pro-Chelsea because of Didier Drogba, Uruguay is a Liverpool stronghold due to the now departed Luis Suarez and Bosnia and Herzegovina is light blue thanks to Edin Dzeko's presence at Manchester City. Arsenal went on tour to Asia in 2013 and they will take part in the 2015 Premier League Asia Trophy in Singapore in the summer . In Asia it is Manchester United (red) who just edge the overall support from Chelsea (blue) and Arsenal (yellow) Liverpool dominate Twitter followers in Australia with pockets of support for Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United as well . The Melbourne Cricket Ground was packed to 95,000 capacity when Liverpool took on Melbourne Victory in July 2013 . And this trend doesn't just happen at the so-called bigger Premier League clubs. Swansea are well supported in South Korea and Iceland presumably because of Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Enner Valencia being at Upton Park has boosted West Ham's following in the striker's native Ecuador and Everton are still popular in Cameroon even though Samuel Eto'o has left the club. Owners may also have a factor - in Malaysia QPR have a stronger-than-average following which could be attributed to the popularity of the club's owner Tony Fernandes in the country. Russia and the former Soviet countries are very much Chelsea hotbeds and again this may be down to the popularity of Roman Abramovich. With clubs always jostling to expand their fan base and Twitter growing popularity, this could be the new battle ground for clubs. Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Diego Costa all contribute to the popularity of Man United, Liverpool and Chelsea across the globe .","Twitter has developed an interactive graphic which shows support for all 20 Premier League clubs across the globe .

Weinsten and his designer wife Georgina Chapman turned up for the premiere of his new Broadway production Finding Neverland in New York City. The play, which stars Glee star Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer, is based on the 2004 film of the same name Weinstein produced starring Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp. The couple have been out together numerous times over the past few weeks as well, attending Finding Neverland rehearsals, celebrating Easter together with their children, and at a party for Georgina’s birthday earlier in the week.

Ambra Battilana (above) claimed Weinstein stuck his hand under her skirt during a meeting at his office in March . Earlier this week Chapman shared a photo of the birthday flowers (above) Weinstein sent her . And while Weinstein may not be thrilled with these reviews, he is not doubt happy with the news that he will not be facing criminal charges for last month's groping incident. District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said last Friday: 'This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. 'After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.'

DeShawn Isabelle punched the 41-year-old woman in the head from behind and then dragged her to the ground by pulling on her hair before continuing to punch her in the head and face as she crouched in the fetal position, according to Assistant State’s Attorney Joe DiBella. Isabelle also stole $2,000 in cash that the woman was going to wire back to her family in Thailand and spent it on junk food, Air Jordan track suits and his graduation fees, DiBella said. Scroll down for video . DeShawn Isabelle, 15, has been arrested for allegedly robbing, beating and sexually assaulting a woman on a Chicago train after his mother recognized his face on surveillance images and turned him in to police . The middle school student was sitting in the otherwise empty carriage when the woman boarded the CTA train in Oak Park on Monday at 3pm, according to the Chicago Tribune. During the brutal beating, Isabelle put his hands inside the woman's pants and sexually assaulted her, according to DiBella. The teen also allegedly groped the woman over her clothes and slapped her buttocks and then sat on her head as he continued to beat her. Isabelle pinned the woman down with his knees when the train stopped at the next station, prosecutors said. When no one entered the carriage, he then dragged the woman by her hair to a partially enclosed area and continued to punch, kick and stomp all over the woman's body as he pushed her face down and demanded money, DiBella said. Isabelle then stole the woman's iPhone and got off on the Cicero stop to hop a train heading in the opposite direction, DiBella said the teenager later told authorities. The woman pushed the car's emergency button after the train began moving again and was attended to by CTA personnel. She was left with bruises and cuts all over her body as well as a concussion after the six-minute ride. Isabelle was sitting in the otherwise empty carriage when the woman boarded the CTA train in Oak Park on Monday at 3pm and allegedly beat and assaulted her during the six minute ride before getting off at Cicero . DiBella said the woman was still vomiting from the extent of her injuries on Wednesday, according to NBC Chicago. Isabelle's mother turned her son in to the police after she recognized his face in surveillance photos publicly released by the CTA following the brutal attack. DiBella said the teenager admitted to robbing, beating and sexually assaulting the woman and gave a handwritten confession. Isabelle's fingerprints were also matched to the train window he was seen touching and kicking in the CTA surveillance video before attacking the woman, according to DiBella. Police also searched the middle school student's home and recovered the jacket he is seen wearing in the video of the assault, DiBella said. Officers were also able to recover the woman's iPhone after Isabelle told them where he had discarded it, according to prosecutors. Isabelle was charged as an adult with aggravated sexual assault and robbery and is being held on $1million bail. The teen was previously convicted as a juvenile for misdemeanor theft. Isabelle's mother became aggravated as DiBella held a press conference to discuss the prosecution's version of the case, according to the Chicago Tribune. 'Don't talk that s*** about my child,' she yelled, before she was told to leave.","DeShawn Isabelle allegedly punched the woman in the head and dragged her to the ground by her hair before repeatedly beating her in Chicago train .

But under their clothing - and in some cases, in their Louis Vuitton bags - they are carrying knives, brass knuckles and pepper spray. Meet some of the more than 200 members of Check It, the only documented gang of gay and transgender youths in America. The teenagers and young adults, who have faced discrimination  throughout their entire lives, are the subjects of a new independent documentary. The film, also named Check It, explains how many of the youths have been stabbed or shot at, while others have served time in juvenile prisons . But now, the 'tight-knit' gang members, who are aged 14 to 22, are fighting to break the cycle of poverty and violence that they have grown up in. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Documentary star: This is one of more than 200 members of Check It, the only documented gang of gay and transgender youths in America . Impoverished area: The gang members, many of whom have been stabbed and shot at, have faced discrimination throughout their lives . Transformation: They are now the subjects of a new independent film, which tells of how some of them have served time in juvenile prisons . Dressing up: But now, the 'tight-knit' gang members (including this member), who are aged 14 to 22, are fighting to break the cycle of poverty and violence that they have grown up in. They are working on their own clothing label, putting on fashion shows and working stints as models . Contrast: The documentary describes how the gang members have to deal with violence and fights on a regular basis (left) but have now launched their own fashion label (right: a youth models for the label) in a bid to escape their 'often brutal' lives in Trinidad, Washington DC . They have set up their own clothing label and are putting on fashion shows in the north-east neighborhood, according to the film and an Indiegogo page. And some of them are even working stints as runway models. All the while, they are offering each other unconditional love and support. 'At its heart, the film explores the undying friendship that exists between these kids - an unbreakable bond that is tested every day,' the page states. However, amid their achievements, the youths often encounter setbacks, with the community they live in 'relentlessly trying to beat them down'. 'When The Check It are not taking small steps forward on the catwalk, they too often take massive steps backwards,' the page explains. The documentary follows the members, led by ex-convict Mo, as they get into fights, are ridiculed by passerbys and struggle with their fashion plans. In its trailer, Dana Flor, who co-directed the film with Toby Oppenheimer, says: 'A lot of times just being black, you have a lot of odds against you.' According to the Washingtonian, she continues: 'Being gay and black... it's like a nightmare waiting to happen.'

Violence to fashion: Gang members are pictured getting into a fight (left), and participating in a fashion show (right) in the independent film . Formed in 2005 by a group of 'bullied 9th graders', Check It now has more than 200 members, all of whom live a life that is 'brutal' but also 'full of hope'. Because the youths - many of whom cross-dress or live transgender lives - are so close, the gang's structure was difficult for filmmakers to infiltrate. However, over a three-year-period, Ms Flor and Mr Oppenheimer gradually managed to immerse themselves in the members' lives in Trinidad. 'These kids have been let down by everybody in their life,' Ms Flor said. 'You have to assert them that you're for real, that you're not going to go away.' He added: 'The documentary will not only go into the challenges members face, but also depict their dream of launching a fashion line.' Actor Steve Buscemi, of New York-based Olive Productions, is producing the documentary, alongside Ms Flor and Mr Oppenheimer. Let down: 'These kids have been let down by everybody in their life... You have to assert them that you're for real, you're not going to go away' Raising money: Filmmakers are raising money to help fund the final editing stages of the film (pictured). They have so far raised $62,630 . They hope the film will expose the discrimination that the gang faces - and show the 'amazing things' the youths are capable of. They also hope it will 'encourage a similarly open-minded conversation about HIV, anti-gay discrimination, and poverty both nationally' and locally.

The Crowd Source collection holds around 150 photographs taken by Arthur Syer, a 27-year-old man living in Sydney who took advantage of the very first hand held camera, the Detective Camera. 'It was the first time people really had the opportunity to take a photograph without their subjects knowing,’ said museum curator and historian Margot Riley. The detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on Sydney streets, defining it as a ‘real revolution and turning point in photography.’ ‘The word snapshot emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters’ She said the detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on Sydney streets, defining it as a ‘real revolution and turning point in photography.’ ‘This was really the beginning of the mass photography you see today. It parallels with the way people look at the world now, always taking images with their phones,’ she said. ‘The word snapshot emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters,’ Ms Riley added. She said that this was the first time people would’ve been confronted with the idea of being photographed or observed on the streets without their knowledge,  spurring on early conversations about privacy laws. This was the first time people were confronted with the idea of being photographed without their knowledge . The camera was wrapped in a small parcel so that it didn't draw attention from the photographers subjects . 'Pesky snap shooters' were the reason people initated early talks about surveillance and privacy . ‘It definitely caused some controversy,' she said. ‘There were plenty of people being annoyed by pesky snap shooters roaming the streets, taking photos of unsuspecting people going about their business.’ The Detective Camera was produced between 1883 and 1887 using a dry negative which was already loaded into the device. It was focused and ready to take a photograph from around six feet away. The camera was loaded, focused and ready to take a photograph at around six feet away . ‘These photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and Kodak box photography.’ It was the first time individuals who weren't trained in the science and chemistry of photography had the opportunity to dabble in the art. ‘Not long after this camera was marketed the roll film and Kodak camera box were invented. ‘These photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and Kodak box photography.’ The photos taken with the hand held camera captured more natural gestures and poses giving us a better sense of the streets and a far more accurate view of our history . ‘You get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation' Ms Riley thinks photos taken with the hand held camera captured more natural gestures and poses giving us a better sense of the streets and a far more accurate view of our history. ‘You get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation. One of the photos shows a group of girls dressed to the nines, many with bare feet- something that was quite normal for that time.’ She said it is important to share this link to our past to ‘encourage people to build a bridge between then and now.’ The candid shots give us a better look at what life was really like for Sydneysiders in the 1880's . People from the Flickr community helped identify landmarks and other details in the photos to help locate where they were taken. This shot is on the corner of Elizabeth and King Street in Sydney's CBD . The images were collected over a period of time and were originally released on the photo hosting website Flickr. They received a 'wonderful response' from the Flickr community with some members even reaching out and helping curators identify where in Sydney the photos were taken.

7591673bf0c43fff729266f85152a5b299c795e6,"College basketball player Lauren Hill lost her battle with cancer on Friday morning, aged just 19. The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer . Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. Fighter: The NCAA moved the school's first game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets . Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling.","Hill was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer when she was 18 and by last September, she was told she would not live past December .

A memorial service has been finalised to take place at the Eat Your Greens function centre in Eugowra, near Ms Scott's home town of Canowindra in rural Central West NSW and around a three hour drive from Leeton where she worked. Ms Scott was excitedly preparing the last minute details for her wedding and her honeymoon to Tahiti with her partner of five years Aaron Leeson-Woolley, when she disappeared from her workplace at Leeton High School on Easter Sunday. She was set to tie the knot last Saturday at the Eat Your Greens centre, instead her life will be celebrated in the same place at a memorial at 1pm this Wednesday. On Thursday the parish priest officiating at the ceremony said he was bracing himself for a hugely emotional occasion. High school teacher Stephanie Scott's funeral will be held at the venue where she was set to get married . A memorial will be held for Ms Scott at the Eat Your Greens centre in Eugowra, near Ms Scott's home town of Canowindra . Reverend Jonno Williams, the parish priest of the Anglican-Uniting Church at Canowindra, confirmed the venue to the ABC. He told Daily Mail Australia he knows the family well and is expecting it to be a tough day for everyone. ‘I know Stephanie’s father relatively well through the time that he taught at the local Canowindra High School,' Reverend Williams told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s going to be a very difficult time for everyone, especially for the young people in town who knew her well.’ Reverend Williams was also yet another person who sang the praises of the young teacher whose heart-breaking tale has gripped Australia in recent weeks. ‘She was vice-captain of Canowindra High School and worked at the local swimming pool when she was younger,' Reverend Williams told Daily Mail Australia. Reverend Jonno Williams, the parish priest of the Anglican-Uniting Church at Canowindra, confirmed Ms Scott's funeral will be held at the Eat Your Greens centre (pictured) The priest told Daily Mail Australia he knows the family well and is expecting it to be a tough day for everyone . Mr Leeson-Woolley and Ms Scott, who was allegedly killed on Easter Sunday, were due to be married last Saturday . Stephanie is seen here having a good time with her friends and family at her hen party . 'She also worked at the local supermarket, so she was well known by everyone here from a young age. ‘Throughout this time Stephanie was always known for her friendly disposition and she was always friendly with anyone that she met. ‘I met her a few times myself and she showed herself to be a very friendly and cheerful girl. The community both here in Canowindra and in Leeton will be out in force to say their goodbyes on Wednesday.’ Less than a week before her wedding the Leeton high school teacher went missing on Easter Sunday. For the past 12 months, Ms Scott had been excitedly preparing her wedding to Mr Leeson-Woolley. The pair met as children playing soccer in the NSW central west town of Canowindra, where they grew up. Ms Scott was a popular teacher at Leeton High School where students paid homage to her . The 26-year-old's burned body was found around five metres from a road in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, on Friday April 10 by police in an area where her accused killer, Vincent Stanford went on regular camping trips. School cleaner Stanford, 24, has been charged with her murder and is due to appear in court in June. The remains of Ms Scott have been formally identified. NSW Health says a post-mortem has been completed at Glebe Morgue in Sydney and a report is in the hands of the coroner. 'Additional testing is being undertaken prior to the release of Ms Scott’s body to her family,' a spokeswoman said. For the past 12 months, Ms Scott had been excitedly preparing her wedding to Mr Leeson-Woolley .

The Department of Forensic Medicine has made contact with Ms Scott's family to provide specialist grief counselling. On Monday, Ms Scott's devastated father opened up about the grief her family is feeling as they struggle to come to terms with their daughter's brutal murder, which took place just days before her wedding. Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to. She was also a person who gave so much joy to others. 'Stephanie's aim was to get everyone feeling like it was their wedding as much as hers,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph, describing Ms Scott's bubbly and thoughtful personality. There are reminders of the wedding all over the house, yet instead of a wedding the Scott family must tragically prepare for Stephanie's funeral. 'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott. Ms Scott and Mr Leeson-Woolley had been taking dancing lessons together to prepare for their first dance as an excited married couple, according to Robert.

5cd7548fbb6ac00c0ddfdcc2d4dab1cbc9b3765a,"Victims of a man who operated a 'revenge porn' website and then charged victims to remove nude images and their personal information spoke out after the man was sentenced on Friday. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was sentenced to 18 years in state prison after he was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion in San Diego Superior Court for running a pair of websites that capitalized on the internet as a forum for public shaming. A group of Bollaert's victims were flown in from around the country to be involved in the prosecution and some have now said that they no longer feel ashamed for sending nude pictures. Victims revealed that they had received a slew of hurtful comments after their nudes were posted and one woman even said she nearly killed herself. Scroll down for video . Shameful: In a first-of-its-kind ruling, Bollaert was sentenced t 18 years for running a 'revenge porn' site, publishing nude and embarassing photos of women sent in anonymously by people wanting to hurt them . Standing up: Three victims, Emily (left), Natlie Coco (center) and Megan Borash (right) spoke out on how having their pictures and information posted on the website affected them . Jilted lovers and hackers could anonymously post nude photos of people without their consent, along with personal information about them, at a website Bollaert created and moderated, called ugotposted.com. More than 10,000 images, mainly of women, were posted between December 2012 and September 2013. People who sought to have the explicit images taken down were directed to changemyreputation.com and charged $250 to $350 to remove the racy content. Victims included teachers, wives and professionals. Nicole Coco was one of the victims who testified in court. She told NBC that after receiving vulgar messages from strangers she went to the police but they were not much help. 'I got the photos removed once. The second time they were like, 'We'll try and try again.' They thought it was my fault, and it was a lot of victim shaming,' said Coco, who had previously tried to commit suicide because of the situation. She said that a California Department of Justice official who contacted her with regards to criminal charges against Bollaert was the first time she was told and felt that having the pictures posted was not her fault. Crying in court: Kevin Bollaert, 28, broke down in tears at his sentencing hearing in San Diego on Friday. He was facing a maximum of 20 years but was given 18, with the judge saying the sentence accurately reflected the amount of victims he hurt . Shaming: Victim Natalie Coco said she had been through a lot of victim shaming before being contacted by a California Department of Justice official who had reached out in regards to criminal charges against Bollaert . 'It was amazing because I blamed myself for a long time before that,' she said. Another victim of Bollaert's website, Megan Borash, said that when the guilty verdict came in she knew was she did 'was not wrong' and that she was 'not ashamed of what' she did. Borash said that the sentencing 'means a lot'. 'Huge weight off my shoulder. I'm out here talking to you, gave you my information. Ask me yesterday, you wouldn't have gotten it. It's time for me to take my life back and start living.' The landmark case was the first time a person had been tried for a running revenge porn ring in the United States. The compromising photos cost people jobs, damaged relationships and led to one attempted suicide. Bollaert earned about $900 a month in website ad revenue and collected about $30,000 from victims. Relief: Victim Megan Borash said that after the guilty verdict came in she realized that what she did was not wrong and that she was 'not ashamed of what' she did . Trauma: One victim, who identified herself as Emily, said that she had received 'crude comments' about her body after pictures of her were posted on the site . Bollaert's lawyer had claimed at trial that the business was gross and offensive, but he didn't break the law by allowing others to post the explicit material. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' Emily Rose-Weber said. But the prosecution said Bollaert terrorized women and enjoyed doing it. Not only would he the photos, but the names, addresses and social media details of the people in them. Many victims were inundated with harassing messages from strangers. Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Some of the women read victim impact statements in court, according to NBC San Diego. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators it was his life that had been ruined by the site . One victim, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's just broken me on a level that's not describable. The only thing I have left is shame and anger.' Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just, like, ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.' 'I mean I know a lot of people are getting screwed over like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,' he said. Criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Tony Solare told NBC that 'revenge porn' cases are hard to prosecute. 'It's hard to prove someone did the act if they did it through a computer. Unless you can prove someone did it with that IP address they can say I didn't do this. I can sit here and think of a million ways people can commit this crime without getting caught,' he said. Terrorized: Some of the victims appeared in court, anonymously, to read victim impact statements. Many said their lives had been irrevocably ruined by Bollaert and his site . Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, was facing 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a despicable scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . He added: 'As far as the volume of [cyber-exploitation crimes] I'm sure [investigators] are woefully understaffed as far as what's out there.' Solare also said that people who think they're victims of cyber exploitation should take a series of important steps. He said: 'If you have a situation like that, you want to sit down and write a detailed account of what occurred, who did it, why you think they did it, what information you can have to specifically tie the bad act to the person you think did it and how you found out about it. 'Because the more information someone has, the more law enforcement has, the more they have to look into it. 'The other thing to do is to not delay in reporting something like this because any delay in reporting of any crime creates any problem for prosecution,' Bollaert is expected to serve at least half his prison sentence and must pay $10,000 in restitution. The trial of Hunter Moore, called 'the most hated man on the Internet' for running isanyoneup.com, is yet to go before court.","Kevin Bollaert was found guilty of 27 counts of identity theft and extortion .

ed7283f0fb3e69cb4daa174aa082a31b02d6075e,"The New Zealand family of fourteen who last month walked out of a remote Christian commune that shuns the outside world are adjusting well to life in the wider community, a relative said, with the father accepting a farm job and the family moving into a home with modern appliances. James and Hope Ben Canaan last month declared they were living in a 'false system' and left the Gloriavale Christian Community, located at Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's West Coast, with their twelve children and few worldly possessions. Founded by the Australian-born evangelical preacher Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - Gloriavale is home to around 500 residents, sometimes known as Cooperites, who wear a plain, blue uniform and reject birth control. Scroll down for video . Free: The Ben Canaan family (picture supplied) have left behind Gloriavale for the outside world. Many family are pictured here in traditional Gloriavale uniforms, although they are now allowed to wear 'modest' clothing . Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament and reject the outside world . The Ben Canaans fled some 300km south to the town of Timaru, where supporters from the Marchwiel Reformed Baptist Church community have helped them adapt to a world where Christmas and birthdays are celebrated and money is used to purchase goods and services. '(They're doing) really, really good,' said Mr Ben Canaan's aunt, Miracle, who herself fled the picturesque commune with her husband and ten children around six years ago. 'They are adapting very well. They've got a job and everything. They've had a lot of support.' The family left Gloriavale, which is located at Lake Haupiri on the west coast of the South Island, for Timaru, around 320km away . Gloriavale residents do not hold celebrations for birthday parties or Christmas . Miracle, the daughter of Neville Cooper (pictured speaking in a previous interview with New Zealand television) said the Ben Canaan family are adapting very well . The Ben Canaans' close supporters have closed ranks around the family, who last month thanked the community for their support and requested privacy in order to 'settle into our new lives' in Timaru. Sources familiar with Gloriavale, such as Miracle - one of Neville Cooper's ten children - discussed the challenges of adjusting to life outside the commune in general terms to Daily Mail Australia. 'There's just a complete struggle in the outside world,' she said, adding that she had 'nothing' when she left but 'managed to get away' from the community 'without too much drama'. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before. 'You know nothing of just normal, everyday stuff - like renting a home, insurance, any of those types of things. 'Often people don't have their birth certificates or bank accounts. They don't even know how to spend money, how to buy things. 'There's birthday parties, Christmas - none of that was practised in the community... It's huge, adapting (to all of that).' The Ben Canaans will now be able to readily access personal technology, like mobile phones and have a television which they can watch without restrictions. Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - is the Australian evangelist who founded the Gloriavale commune after clashing with church leaders in New Zealand and Australia. In 1995, he spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges . Former Gloriavale residents tend to find it difficult to adapt from the outside world, a former resident told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before' The Ben Canaans no longer have to wear their Gloriavale 'uniform'. Instead, Miracle said they will now wear 'modest clothes'. The women in the family will also have to adjust to a world where make-up is worn regularly. Author Fleur Beale, who wrote the book Sins of The Father about the 1989 escape of Neville Cooper's son, Phil, and his family from the commune, said the biggest challenge the Ben Canaans would have would be financial, particularly given their 12 children. 'You can imagine what it's like trying to find a place to live with a family like that,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Gloriavale residents are often dubbed 'Cooperites'. Pictured is a Gloriavale wedding . The happy couple kiss as they are led from their wedding ceremony . 'You haven't been used to handling money or buying in a shop. And what do you wear?' The details of the Ben Canaans' departure from Gloriavale remain unclear. Miracle said the community was not surrounded with large walls, but: 'There are different types of walls... 'Psychological walls as well as physical barriers, but no access to telephones and long driveways to be able to leave.' A spokesman for the commune, Fervant Steadfast, told the New Zealand Herald last month the family had been permitted to depart. 'If they want to go and live in Timaru, well, that's their choice and that's what they need to do. 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist. Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book Sins of the Father, said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can. That's why they have big families.' Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt. And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms. The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels.","A New Zealand family of fourteen walked out of remote Christian sect .

f873cc92d02cd04d1b6164fd3659b3fa247cdf56,"David Cameron will say that high taxes are 'immoral' as 14 million working households receive a tax cut . David Cameron will say today that high taxes and wasteful government spending are ‘immoral’ as millions receive a tax cut. As 14million working households – more than nine in ten – are given an average boost of £200 a year to their incomes, the Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money – because they ‘know best’ how it should be spent. And he will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on ‘bureaucracy’ and ‘crackpot Government schemes’. ‘There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers’ money,’ he will say. ‘And we believe it’s people – not politicians – who know best how to spend their own money. And that’s what today is all about.’ He will add that it is ‘wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees’. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub ‘money back Monday’, are: . Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to £15,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of £17 a month. And nearly million pensioner households – more than nine in ten – will benefit by £15 a month. Middle income households earning around £23,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a ‘better and fairer place to live’, adding that low taxes ‘go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. ‘For me, there’s the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. ‘There’s the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. ‘But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.’ He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit ‘without reaching into working people’s pockets like Labour would’. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they’ve never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? ‘The truth is millions are worse off because of this government’s choices. ‘And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less. Two years ago today they gave the top one per cent of earners in our country a £3billion a year tax cut.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes . The Lib Dems said that the changes to income tax had been part of their manifesto and said Labour would cost 24million taxpayers £340 a year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today: ‘In government, we secured a tax cut totalling £825 every year for millions of ordinary working people. We now plan to take this further, raising the [tax-free personal allowance] threshold to £12,500 and giving millions of people a further tax cut worth nearly £400.’","More than nine in ten working households will receive a tax cut from today .

Vonda Thedford, 55, told Fox News that she was driving along a Pittsburg County rural road earlier this month when she spotted the mysterious carcass lying on the ground. When she stopped to look at the dead creature, she was disturbed to see it had 'a little truck' in place of a nose, 'little toes' and 'hair on its tail'. In a bid to document the unusual-looking beast, she whipped out her camera phone. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: An Oklahoma woman believes she has secured photographic evidence of the legendary blood sucking beast, el chupacabra (above) The restaurant worker says the images have left people baffled and no-one has been able to identify the bloated and hairless critter. 'I know it's something logical,' Thedford said, 'I know it's not an alien, I know it's not Bigfoot's aborted child, like people are coming up with.' Desperate to unravel the mystery, Thedford revisited the dead animal. As the flesh had rotted away, she took the remaining bones with her. Strange encounter: Vonda Thedford, 55, told Fox News that she was driving along a Pittsburg County rural road earlier this month when she spotted the mysterious carcass lying on the ground . She noted that although the area stunk of death, there were strangely no flies or maggots around. Wildlife experts who studied the skeleton told Fox News the bones appear to be from a young dog. However, Thedford insists she stumbled across something far more sinister. 'I lived a long time in New Mexico and they call it the ‘chupacabra' out there so that's what we've been calling it.' The legend of the chupacabra dates back to 1995 in Puerto Rico, where many local farmers claimed to have seen the animal after finding their livestock had been killed. Left behind: Desperate to unravel the mystery, Thedford revisited the dead animal - as the flesh had rotted away, she took the remaining bones with her. Bizarre discovery: Thedford says the images have left people baffled and no-one has been able to identify the bloated and hairless critter . Explanation: Wildlife experts who studied the skeleton told Fox News they appear to be from a young dog . Sightings of the animal have been reported throughout Mexico and much of the US, particularly in the Southwest, where it is usually determined that suspected chupacabras are just emaciated, sickly coyotes. The description of the chupacabra varies, but typically those who claim to see the animal describe it as being about the size of a small bear, with a row of spines along its back. In 2004, a rancher near San Antonio killed a supposed chupacabra that he claimed had been killing his livestock. DNA from the animal later revealed that it was a coyote with demodectic or sarcoptic mange. In a dozen other cases where the suspected chupacabra's body has been discovered, DNA testing showed that the animal was some sort of wild canine with severe skin disorders, particularly mange. LEGEND OF EL CHUPACABRA . The word comes from two Spanish words - 'chupar', to suck, and 'cabra', goat. The first reported sighting was in 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Thus, the legend of the livestock killing, vampire-like chupacabra was born. Since then, the legendary beast has been spotted across the Americas and even the world. A Mexican incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on El Chupacabra in 2012. Earlier this year, yet another Mississippi sighting came when a Leake County man actually shot and killed what he claimed was El Chupacabra. Even a Belarusian town had a Chupacabra sighting this past July . SCIENCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN . Scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be El Chupacabra are actually wildlife like coyotes, foxes, and stray dogs infested with parasites. Most commonly pointed to is the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes mange. Mange is a painful, potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel, making for an even more ghoulish looking beast. In humans, Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies and a consequent itchy, painful rash as the parasites burrow around, leaving their feces under the skin. 'Goat sucker': The legend of El Chupacabra likely originates from a 1995 case in Puerto Rico where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds. It has been described as hairless, or as having spines along its back, and as having blue or red eyes .","Vonda Thedford, 55, said she was driving along a Pittsburg County rural road earlier this month when she spotted the mysterious carcass .

The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child. His wife Louise was at the court on Thursday and successfully applied to alter a freezing order. Under the order Maurice Van Ryn is not allowed to dispose of a property, superannuation distributions and shares or securities in four companies. It allows him to spend up to $500 a week on living expenses and $25,000 on legal bills. Maurice Van Ryn is now allowed to sell off some of his assets to support his wife and pay off debts. It was varied to permit the sale of the property, on condition that half the net proceeds be paid to the court after debts secured against the house were settled. Under the new order Van Ryn also has to pay his wife Louise, who applied for the variation, up to $5,165 per month, until the property is sold. He also has to give her up to $150,000 so she can repay his debts. Included in that is $25,000 'for her ordinary living expenses', the orders state.

87b6241c4336a005a2b3cf52e92c2415f174cc57,"Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself in 2012 after she was sexually assaulted at a party. Two of her attackers have finally apologized and admitted she was unconscious during the 'criminal act' Two teenagers have finally apologized for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl who later committed suicide after images of the attack were shared around her high school. The pair, who have not been named, admitted Audrie Pott was unconscious at the time and did not consent to their 'criminal acts' as they reached a civil settlement with her family. They also apologized for sharing false rumors spread around Saratoga High School in Northern California that 'served to shame and humiliate her'. The teenager fell asleep after drinking Gatorade laced with vodka at a friend's party in their hometown of Saratoga. She awoke to find her pants off and lewd comments scribbled over her body. Her family says she hanged herself days later after learning cellphone photos were taken of her during the assault and shared through text messages. Audrie's parents, Lawrence and Sheila Pott, filed a civil lawsuit against the boys to hold them more accountable for their actions. Their attorney, Bob Allard, said the parents decided to settle with one of the teens because he showed remorse and 'told the truth' about what happened to Audrie. Now the final two teens have reached an agreement after initially refusing to say sorry - reportedly paying $950,000 to the devastated family. As part of the settlement, they were also made to release a lengthy apology and will have to give presentations about 'sexting', sharing nude photos, 'slut-shaming' and the dangers of alcohol. The pair said:  'We apologize that we said things that made it seem like Audrie invited or encouraged these acts. 'We admit that we committed these acts and shared inappropriate images of Audrie to others. 'Audrie wasn't conscious during these criminal acts that we committed and did not consent to what we did.' They also apologized for false rumors that 'served to shame and humiliate her'. It continued: 'We would like every teenager out there to understand that words about someone's character can have a life altering effect. That taking advantage of an incapacitated human being is a crime each and every time. They also said they would participate and support a petition to to the Saratoga High School Administration to give Audrie an honorary diploma, because their 'actions contributed to prevent her from graduating. During a hearing on Friday, the boys stood up and apologized to the courtroom, including Audrie's parents, to mark the signing of the agreement. According to the San Jose Mercury, one of them said: 'I wish Audrie was still here, and I miss her a lot. She was a great person who didn't deserve anything that happened to her due to my actions. I apologize. I wish I could make it right.' Anger: Larry Pott and and Audrie's stepmother and his second wife Lisa, have finally settled their lawsuit against two of their daughter's attackers after one admitted and apologized . Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . Tormentors: The three teenagers (pictured with their faces obscured) pleaded guilty to sexual assault last year and were sentenced to 30-45 days in a juvenile detention facility . The second teen, who is now a senior at Christopher High in Gilroy, said that if he could, he would 'take back the pain and suffering I caused Audrie and the Pott family. This has caused a tragedy to all involved due to my actions.' He added: 'I will do everything I can to mentor teens to not do what I did in September 2012.' The teenagers also agreed to be interviewed in a documentary film already in production about the case. The three attackers, all classmates, were prosecuted in private juvenile proceedings and sentenced to between 30 and 45 days in juvenile hall. Two continue to attend Saratoga High, while the third transferred to high school about an hour south in Gilroy. Allard said that had the two other teens apologized, they might not have been sued. 'If they had simply knocked on the door of the Pott household, apologized, accepted responsibility and jumped headfirst into our quest to educate our youth by, for example, speaking at high schools about the mistakes they made and how this can be prevented, there would be no civil lawsuit,' Allard said. Audrie's parents led the campaign to pass a California law which allows prosecutors to seek harsher sentences for juvenile sex offenders who take pictures of their crimes and use them to bully the victims. The trio of teenagers whom Daily Mail Online is not identifying because they are minors, pleaded guilty in January 2014 and were sentenced to 30 to 45 days each in a juvenile detention facility. Pott, from Saratoga, California, hung herself September 10, 2012 - just eight days after the teens digitally penetrated her at an alcohol-fueled Labor Day party and took pictures of her in a compromised state. The 15-year-old girl felt humiliated after she discovered that the cellphone photos showing her naked body covered in lewd comments written in marker had been shared with students at her school. In February, Pott's parents tried to get all three expelled from their schools - which they returned to after their sentences. Cruel: Pott, right, was assaulted after a night of drinking and boys spread photos of the attack . They launched a petition on the site Change.org calling on the principals of Saratoga High School and Christopher High School to expel the three perpetrators responsible for Audrie's 'slut-shaming.' At a party in early September 2012, Audrie Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade and woke up without her shorts on, with her face painted black and with mocking comments written in indelible marker all over her body. Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault, which involved digital penetration, and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers. 'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident. She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos. 'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.' Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Left behind: Audrie is pictured left with her father, step mother and half brother and sisters . Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house. In police interviews, the teenagers admitted to coloring half of her face black with marker, then pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school. She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'","Parents of Audrie Pott reach financial settlement with remaining two teens .

Michelle Schwab, who has three sons and a degree in therapeutic childcare, has been charged with child endangerment after  she allegedly dangled her child over the 10-foot-deep enclosure in Cleveland Metroparks Zoo before he slipped and fell. She faces six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Visitors heard a scream at 3pm on Saturday and looked to see Schwab, 38, and her husband leaping into the pit to retrieve the child, who was treated for a leg injury. On Monday, a spokesman for KinderCare, a nationally-acclaimed education, care and resource provider, confirmed Schwab has taken a leave of absence from her management role at one of the centers in Columbus, Ohio. Scroll down for video . Charged: Michelle Schwab, a mother-of-three with a degree in therapeutic childcare, has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly dangling her son of a cheetah pit. She is an assistant director at KinderCare . Witnesses say Schwab jumped in to retrieve the boy from the compound at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo at 3pm on Saturday. The animals appeared to ignore the boy, witnesses say (file image of one of the zoo's cheetahs) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . In an email to DailyMail.com, spokesman Colleen Moran said: 'We were saddened to hear of Saturday’s incident at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo involving Michelle Schwab’s son, and we wish him a speedy recovery. 'Ms Schwab has been the Assistant Director at the Sawmill Road KinderCare in Columbus. She is currently home with her family, and will remain out of our center while this issue is investigated and addressed. 'In addition to the agencies looking into this issue, we are looking into the incident further ourselves, as we closely examine issues involving the treatment of children by our employees, even if those incidents arise outside of our centers.' Schwab, of Delaware, Ohio, was charged on Monday in Cleveland Municipal Court and will be arraigned on April 22. On Sunday, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said the two felines did not approach the boy when he fell in the pit. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream.

d093d988ba09940c73f8a793a159f8eadefa4882,"Dashcam footage has revealed the startling moment a Texas trooper ran toward a motorcyclist following a high-speed chase, leaped into the air and karate kicked him to the ground. The unconventional maneuver led to a three-day, unpaid suspension for Trooper Abraham Martinez last year but the footage only emerged this week as the Austin American Statesman investigated outdated tactics used in Department of Public Safety pursuits. The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran trooper, took chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near Houston. Gaydos knew he was being pursued but drove off because he was driving on a suspended license. Jump: Trooper Abraham Martinez is seen leaping into the air to kick Steven Gaydos after he fled from authorities in Houston in 2012 as he drove in a suspended license . Contact: Martinez was ultimately suspended for three days without pay for the unconventional tactic . 'I took off, thinking I could easily lose him,' he said in a later interview. But troopers followed Gaydos for nearly 40 miles at speeds of 130 mph before Martinez pulled alongside him and fired four times through the window of his moving car, striking the man once in the thigh. The motorcyclist then raised his hand and pulled over and, as he tried to put down his kickstand, Martinez suddenly leaped out at him, kicked him and knocked him to the ground. Gaydos was arrested for evading law enforcement, driving with an invalid license and possessing a prescription painkiller after he was found to be carrying two Percocet pills. The Statesman reported that the kick and shooting from a moving vehicle don't specifically violate the Texas Department of Public Safety rules for high-speed chases, but experts said that shooting at fleeing suspects was an area of the policy that needed updating. Knocked down: After the kick, Gaydos fell to the ground. Martinez had also shot him once in the leg . Surrender: Ahead of the kick, Gaydos could be seen raising a hand to troopers and pulling over . After the incident, Martinez said he pulled out his weapon to avoid harm coming to anyone else on the road and only intended to shoot Gaydos' tires. He did not strike the bike with any of the bullets. 'I knew that it was necessary to terminate the pursuit in order to avoid any more injuries or serious bodily injuries, possibly even deaths from happening,' he said in an interview with a supervisor. As for the kick, 'obviously we don't teach that,' he said. 'I think it's something that just comes natural to some of us.' He said he opted for the unusual move because experience taught him to act decisively in case the suspect was armed. In February 2013, a grand jury declined to indict Martinez for the shooting but he was eventually ordered to take three days off last summer for violating DPS policy by using force inconsistent with his training, the Statesman reported. Both men have declined requests to comment. Caught: Gaydos, left in his mug shot, was arrested for evading law enforcement, driving with an invalid license and possessing a prescription painkiller after he was found to be carrying two Percocet pills .

8ac405eabc14bfbddfab79f7f9fb73251c241890,"The grandmother of a Virginia teen missing since March 2 came out swinging Sunday at authorities who she says have been 'doing nothing' to bring the girl home. Katherine Hadsell says she's eager for police in Norfolk to give 'more insight into what they're actually doing' to find 18-year-old college student Anjelica Hadsell. The Longwood University student was home for spring break when she vanished. Police just this past week focused their search on a pond near Carrsville after getting a new tip that her cell phone may be below its surface. Scroll down for video . Concerned? Katherine Hadsell says police aren't doing enough to find 18-year-old AJ, who's been missing for a month. Further, she says her son - AJ's stepfather Wesley Hadsell - was arrested unjustly as he took it upon himself to investigate the crime by breaking into a Norfolk area home . Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2. Meanwhile, the family says they've been left in the dark about how, exactly, police were led to the pond in the first place. And Hadsell's stepfather has found himself the focus of area police after he was caught allegedly breaking into a home two weeks after Anjelica's disappearance, an act his mother Katherine says was out of fatherly concern. Katherine Hadsell told ABC News her son Wesley had heard his stepdaughter could be inside the home. 'As any father would, if you hear that your daughter may or may not be in a house or being held or some of her belongings or at a location, any father is going to try and find out,' Katherine Hadsell said. Hadsell had not been named a suspect as he awaited a hearing on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. Local resident Steve Hines over the weekend said that divers were searching the outer edges of the pond for the Longwood University freshman's phone, which sent strange text messages to her mother shortly after her disappearance. AJ Hadsell (left) was last seen driving near her parents' home in Norfolk and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell (right) was taken into custody late last month after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to 13 News Now. Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing. He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road. He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges . Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond . 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month . Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month . He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. Now he says that he is a changed man. Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance. Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time. AJ's family and friends discovered items of her clothing two weeks ago near the side of the road in a remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake. Four items were found that belonged to her. AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.","Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2, when she was home in Norfolk while on spring break from Longwood University .

A man charged with multiple counts of sexual abuse against young boys killed himself the day before his trial. Chad Geyen, a married father of two from Ramsey, Minnesota, was found dead on Sunday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a park near his home. He had been accused of assaulting at least six boys hundreds of times, including his own foster son, between 1990 and 2013. The Star Tribune reports that Geyen, 45, was first reported missing on Saturday night, having been out on bail since he was first charged in November 2013. He was set to stand trial on five counts of first-degree and two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. Of the six individuals who have come forward, four are now adults, with the oldest saying the abuse began between him and Geyen when he was part of the Big Brothers organization. Another boy claims Geyen once paid him $20 to perform a sexual act, while a third actually lived with the man as his foster child. That individual says he was 5-years-old when the abuse began, and that it occurred hundreds of times. All the boys were under the age of 13 when the alleged abuse began. While investigating, authorities found a fake Facebook account created by Geyen in which he claimed to be a 13-year-old girl to communicate with young boys. There was also visits to a 'boy-love' site in his web history. 'It’s pretty unusual [for abuse cases] to go undetected after having this much contact with victims over such a long period of time,' said Anoka County Sheriff’s Cmdr. Paul Sommer when the charges were first filed. 'There were hundreds of alleged incidents.'

18aa6b92a491899111f8a6ef68cb8b78d559aa8a,"Shelly Sterling has spoken out about her legal victory over her husband's alleged mistress V. Stiviano, saying she took the much-younger woman to court 'for justice'. The billionaire wife of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling said she felt vindicated by the judge's ruling this week that Stiviano, 32, must return $2.6 million in sugar daddy gifts. Donald Sterling, 80, had lavished his alleged girlfriend with gifts including a $1.8 million house, luxury cars and stocks - all while hiding them from his wife of six decades. But Shelly insisted on Wednesday she didn't take them to court over the money. Scroll down for video . Vindicated: Shelly Sterling, pictured at a Clippers game last month, will receive $2.6 million from a woman her husband Donald showered with gifts. Shelly has said she took the woman to court 'for justice' 'I did it for justice,' she said. 'I think when somebody harms you in so many ways, justice has to prevail.' Shelly Sterling said she would donate the proceeds to charity. Despite acknowledging marital problems, she also said she and her husband never separated. She said she drafted divorce papers last year, but never filed them. The couple testified at trial last month in Los Angeles Superior Court about their love for each other, displaying cards they had exchanged. Still, Donald Sterling is suing his wife and the NBA over the $2 billion sale of the team. A year ago, a recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to associate with black people led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. His wife then negotiated a deal to sell the team with ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer after doctors found Donald Sterling incompetent to handle his business affairs. Together: Donald Sterling is pictured with V. Stiviano in 2011 as they watch the Clippers play. He lost the team last year after a recording emerged in which he told Stiviano not to be seen with black people . Shelly added on Wednesday that she mourns the loss of the team. 'It was a horrible thing to go through,' she said. 'They were like my family. To this day I still feel very bad about it.' Her husband's lawyer on Wednesday criticized her lawsuit as a 'pet project' that had extended Stiviano's time in the spotlight. 'The sums spent by Shelly Sterling in pursuing this matter likely exceeds any amount that will be recovered,' attorney Bobby Samini said. 'We remain perplexed that so much time, energy and money have been allocated to litigating with Ms. Stiviano.' Shelly Sterling's attorney scoffed at that statement. 'What do you expect from the lawyer for a husband who was caught red-handed gifting his mistress with millions of dollars of family money,' Pierce O'Donnell said. In court: Stiviano, pictured heading to court last month, accepted gifts worth $2.6 million from the older man and has now been ordered to hand them back over. The exact nature of their relationship was never clear . Shelly Sterling had filed the suit against Stiviano a month before the recording of her husband telling Stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the NBA to ban him for life. In court, Shelly Sterling's lawyers used other recordings from Stivian's iPhone to show he bought his alleged mistress a house, a Ferrari and other things. Stiviano and the 80-year-old billionaire were heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife. 'The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,' Stiviano said in snippet played in court. During the course of their two and a half years together, Sterling gave her a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex. Sterling testified that he paid for the house, though Stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer. But Judge Richard Fruin Jr. said this claim was 'not believable' and he relied instead on a recording in which she told Donald Sterling: 'I want Shelly to know you bought me the house.' Still smiling: Stiviano, pictured showing off her new braces, was seen out in Los Angeles earlier this month . He ruled earlier this week that Stiviano must now turn over the keys to the $1.8 million house and pay Shelly Sterling some $800,000 that her husband showered on the younger woman in gifts. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers games. In the subsequent furor, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2 billion. The recording was leaked weeks after Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano, alleging she was her husband's mistress but the exact nature of their relationship was never clear. Stiviano called him a lover and father figure but said they never had sex. Donald Sterling called her an 'ex-friend' on the witness stand, though he said in recordings that he loved her and wanted to give her everything.","A Los Angeles judge ruled this week that V.

The baby was found on the floor of the roach infested apartment with bites on her legs and head. Brittany Cherokee Dawn Bell of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, appeared in Washington County District Court via video monitor from jail on Monday. The charge of child neglect was pursued by authorities over homicide as the Medical Examiner's Office could not determine the cause of death. Police were called to Bell's home on January 8 after she reported the death of the infant. Brittany Cherokee Dawn Bell of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, was charged with child neglect after the death of her three-month-old daughter, whose body was found with roach bites on her legs and head . While Bell slept on the couch, baby Alice somehow suffocated on the floor nearby. It is unclear how this happened and for how long she lay there . Her initial story was that she had put the baby, Alice, in a crib and then found her dead later on. She then changed her story and admitted to laying the baby on the floor. Bell said that the baby might have been smothered by her 18-month-old twins out of jealousy after she had fallen asleep while watching a movie with them. She said she was afraid one of them had killed Alice by sitting on her, which was why she initially said the child was in the crib. An autopsy listed the cause of death as sudden unexplained infant death with the manner of death undetermined. The medical examiner found abrasions on Alice's legs and head caused by roaches that infested the apartment. In an affidavit, investigator Jim Warring said: 'I can conclude that she laid the baby on the floor and fell asleep without waking during which time Alice may have been suffocated by one or both of her twins or became distressed due to the surface of the floor and suffocated.' 'Also enough time passed that roaches were able to start feeding on both the baby's legs and head,' he added. 'All of this took place less than 10 feet from the couch where Bell was reportedly sleeping.' Bell's initial story was that she had put baby Alice in a crib and found her dead later on. She then changed her story, telling authorities that she was worried one of her twins had smothered the baby . The charge of child neglect relates to a previous incident, on December 31, when a neighbor called police concerned that the children had been left alone and were crying. Bell returned to the apartment approximately five minutes after officers arrived and claimed not to have been away for very long, and acted like it was not a big deal. Neighbors told police that the children had been left alone on other occasions. The twins were taken away from Bell after the death of Alice. Tulsa World reported that Bell has other children but they are not in her care. The affidavit stated: 'Enough evidence and probable cause exists to determine that the defendant has acted in a reckless and neglectful manner that has been dangerous and possibly fatal to the children in her care and custody.' Associate District Judge Russell Vaclaw set her bond at $10,000, and scheduled a May 8 hearing.","Three-month old baby Alice died of unknown causes and was found with roach bites on her legs and head .

4a0ec7505bab2c710206074f7fe9b28d2cdcd1e4,"Tim Sherwood's jacket did not survive beyond the first 10 minutes and after this astonishing contest it remains to be seen if either of these sides fare much better. When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross . Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season . If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right.

At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points .

Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal – his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post. Are they man enough? Only time will tell.","Matt Phillips gave QPR a seventh-minute lead in the crunch clash at Villa Park .

The former 2Day FM co-host, who shot to notoriety in 2012 after a prank call during the Duchess of Cambridge's first pregnancy resulted in the death of the nurse who took the call, penned the letter to ask the media, 'Have we not learnt enough from the royal prank call?'. The 33-year-old said in the letter that with the impending birth of the second child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, she understood the pressure of needing to find 'a new angle' when providing coverage of news events, offering assurance that she had been in the same position. Scroll down for video . Former Australian radio host Mel Greig has written an open letter to the media, warning of the harmful consequences of always seeking for a new angle on world events . 'I sat there and agreed to prank call a hospital to create a “unique angle” a harmless and stupid idea that sadly ended in tragedy, as we felt obliged to cover the pregnancy and to do it differently,' she wrote in the letter published by The Daily Telegraph. The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to be overdue by five days as she had been due to give birth last Thursday . Greig and fellow 2Day FM co-host Michael Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles as part of the prank in 2012 to gain information about the Duchess of Cambridge following the birth of Prince George. Jacintha Saldana was the nurse who took the call at King Edward Hospital in London, taking her life two days later and blaming her decision on the actions of the Australian radio hosts. Greig has since revealed her personal torment over the prank, and was unable to return to her role on the air, saying earlier in the year that she felt 'the world hated [her]' for what had happened. In the letter, Greig asks why the media continues to seek fresh angles for stories after seeing the consequences of her mistake, and asks various media outlets to learn from the tragedy of Ms Saldana's death and to be sensible when it comes to covering the birth of the second royal baby. 'Respect their privacy, stay away from the hospital and think of others when working out what angles to pursue. For anyone that is actually considering trying to repeat our stupidity from 2012, DON’T,' Greig wrote. She declared in the letter that there was no need for a fresh angle on the birth, as the fact that a new baby was being born was sufficient, and that her only response would be to congratulate the parents. The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to be five days overdue, and many fans and media have camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where she will give birth. The 33-year-old said that while she thought the media industry was 'wonderful', she said that there needs to be a 'line' that is never crossed when reporting news. Greig goes on to recount the moment when her own family was hounded by someone she knew when her father and her whole street was 'doorknocked' for information following the scandal in 2012. 'I’ve crossed the line too. But the difference is, I’ve learnt from it and I’ll continue to work in the media so I can help others to think before they act. You don’t need to be careless to create great content,' she finished. Jacintha Saldana committed suicide two days after taking the prank call and blamed the radio hosts .

The Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where the Duchess will give birth. The facility don't normally wait for more than a week before helping the baby along . The Duchess of Cambridge's royal’s baby is expected before the end of April - with the due date initially reported as yesterday, but later claimed to actually be as early as Wednesday last week. Either way Kate - who plans to give birth at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London - is now overdue and may have already spoken to doctors about the possibility of being induced. Earlier in the year, Greig spoke to BBC2 Radio and spoke of her continual anguish over her actions in 2012. 'I was in disgust with myself, I had failed as a human being, to be involved in someone's death is horrific and it affected me greatly,' she told BBC2 Radio listeners. While Ms Greig said that she now understands that 'there is more to mental health...it's not normally an event like that that can trigger someone to commit suicide,' she experienced overwhelming guilt at the time. Ms Greig said she had experienced deep depression for a year, and claimed that the event had changed her life permanently. Last year, Ms Greig said that she believed the incident would stay with her forever, but that she has done all she can do now that she has personally apologised to her family.

The new royal baby's big brother Prince George was three days overdue when he was born on July 22, 2013 . 'I don’t know how you completely forgive yourself – someone wrote my name in their suicide note,' she told Sunrise. 'They thought of me before they took their own life and that will stay with me forever but I can move forward from that point I think because I've tried to say sorry.' 'It was really tough but I made that promise to them over a year ago that if they wanted answers I would go to the inquest so I was always going to go,' she said. 'To be able to to look them in the eye and say sorry was incredibly hard but it’s something I felt I needed to do – everyone was very emotionally involved in that room.' Ms Greig now hopes she can try to move on with her life. 'I do have a little bit more closure and I’ve been finding it so hard to move forward and I think a lot of that had a lot to do with not being able to say sorry – just bearing that guilt and that blame,' she said. 'To know that I have done everything I can – I tried to help – I said sorry – I feel that I've redeemed myself as much as I can and I hope they got the answers to find the closure as well.'

Ms Greig said that the incident had changed her forever and that she felt like the 'world hated [her]' When asked how others involved in the prank had been able to put the tragedy behind them, Ms Greig simply replied that people handle situations differently. 'Some people were able to just move on from that – I wasn’t – it deeply affected me for a long time and when you are the face of blame publicly you believe it,' she said. 'As well, knowing Jacintha herself has written my name in that suicide note and blamed me directly – you hold yourself responsible.' Ms Greig spoke of how the incident had taken its toll on her over the past two and a half years. 'It took every bit of strength and every bit of support to get through that but you have a choice you can keep fighting or you can let it just take you over and I wanted to fight - life is so precious,' she said. 'I wanted to try to get better and a part of that was going to the inquest and saying sorry and helping the family out so combined I feel I’ve got everything so I can truly move forward.'","Former 2Day FM host Mel Greig penned an open note to the media .

39146c90a60efdd651f7bd4d038e90b6c153876e,"A former Florida State University student has filed a lawsuit against top NFL prospect Jameis Winston, claiming he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012. The lawsuit by Erica Kinsman, which seeks damages from the former Seminoles quarterback, was filed two weeks before the April 30 NFL draft. Winston could be selected as the first overall pick. Winston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013. He also was cleared by the university following a two-day student conduct hearing last year. The hearing was held to determine whether Winston violated four sections of the code of conduct - two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment. Scroll down for video . Former Florida State University student Erica Kinsman filed a civil lawsuit against top NFL prospect Jameis Winston, saying he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012 . Former FSU quarterback and Heisman winner Winston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013 . But John Clune, a lawyer for Kinsman, said in a statement there are consequences for Winston's behavior 'and since others have refused to hold him accountable, our client will.' 'Erica hopes to show other survivors the strength and empowerment that can come from refusing to stay silent no matter what forces are against you,' Clune said. December 7, 2012 - Erica Kinsman files a police report claiming she was raped, though she can not identify the attacker. January 10, 2013 - She tells Tallahassee police she recognizes Winston as the assailant in a class and hears a professor call his name. November 13, 2013 - Prosecutor Willie Meggs is notified of the allegations and pushes police on an investigation, during which key witnesses are interviewed and evidence is sought. November 2013 - Kinsman drops out of FSU, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston. December 5, 2013 - Meggs decides against pursuing criminal charges, saying that evidence is insufficient. December 14, 2013 - Winston wins the Heisman Trophy, becoming the youngest player, at 19, to do so. January 6, 2014 - Winston and the Seminoles win the BCS championship against Auburn. December 21, 2014 - FSU clears Winston of any code of conduct violations after hearing presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding. He added: 'Jameis Winston in contrast has proven time and time again to be an entitled athlete who believes he can take what he wants. 'He took something here that he was not entitled to and he hurt someone. Kinsman told her alleged sexual assault story publicly in a documentary titled The Hunting Ground, which casts a critical eye on the role that fraternities, athletic departments and schools play in rape investigations on campus. Kinsman fights tears as she details her account of the December 2012 night, when as a freshman, she remembers running into a man at a Tallahassee Potbelly's, according to the Daily Beast. She says someone was creepily following her around the bar throughout the night and only stopped when a second man put his arm around her and told the pursuer he was her boyfriend. Kinsman claims that man then bought her a shot, after which she began to feel dizzy, although she faintly recalls taking a cab to an apartment. She says the next thing she remembers is coming to while the man on top of her, penetrating her, and claims that she asked him to stop. The man allegedly ignored both her and his roommate, who Kinsman says entered the room, when they told him to stop. He then took her into the bathroom, Kinsman said. There, she says, he raped her while he held her head against the tiles, and when he was finished told her, 'You can leave now.' Not knowing where the apartment was, Kinsman says she took an offer for a ride on the man's scooter back to a location she recognized, fearing what would happen if he knew where she lived. Kinsman's lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress . Winston has avoided criminal charges, and a Florida State University conduct code hearing found there was not enough evidence to determine whether he was guilty . According to a New York Times investigation of the ensuing police investigation, Kinsman reported the assault in the early morning immediately after it happened, but did not identify the assailant. Tallahassee Police Officer Scott Angulo wrote he 'had no real leads' until Kinsman contacted police a month later, saying she saw the man in class and heard his name called, identifying him as Winston. The lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress. Because the burden of proof is much lower in a civil lawsuit than in a criminal case, Kinsman could have a better chance of winning a jury verdict if it goes to trial. David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami, said in a civil case the standard amounts to the 'greater weight' of the evidence, or 'merely tipping the scales in favor of the plaintiff.' In a criminal case, prosecutors must prove a person's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning jurors must be entirely convinced of guilt. Kinsman dropped out of FSU after the incident, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston . A month after prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges, Winston led the Seminoles to a comeback victory against Auburn in the BCS title game . 'The scales have to be tipped all the way over to the side of the prosecution,' said Weinstein, who is not involved in the case. Weinstein also said that he thought Kinsman's chances of prevailing were good, based on the detailed allegations and multiple witness statements in the lawsuit. But that doesn't mean it will be easy. 'The defense will drag her character through the mud, so this is going to be an unpleasant process for her,' he said. 'However, Winston has a lot to lose, so I foresee a settlement and not a trial.' Kinsman has also filed a lawsuit against FSU's trustees, asserting that university officials had knowledge of her alleged sexual harassment and discrimination by the star quarterback and this created a hostile educational environment for her. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including reimbursement for tuition, damages for emotional pain and suffering and loss of past and present earning and earning capacity. Lawyers for the university's board of trustees contend the lawsuit should be dismissed because it does not show that FSU was responsible for her harassment, but they also maintain that they offered her assistance. Kinsman's story was featured in the documentary film The Hunting Ground, which is an expose on the way fraternities, athletic departments and universities affect rape investigations .","Erica Kinsman filed lawsuit seeking damages from the former quarterback .

e314cc9a7bb35fe8cfdbb4b9af410d65e2215bdf,"Don't be fooled, Arsene. Don’t be caught out by this impressive run of form and think everything is in place for a crack at the title next year. It is not uncommon to see Arsenal finish a season with a string of good results. Usually they rattle out a sequence of wins just in time to preserve their place in the top four but too late to affect the destiny of the Barclays Premier League. The same thing has happened this year. Chelsea were relentless from the first whistle and have had the title race firmly under control since before Christmas. Arsenal players celebrate after their extra-time winner against Reading in the FA Cup semi-finals last week . Alexis Sanchez jumps in the air and celebrates wildly after his second goal for Arsenal at Wembley . With a 10-point advantage, even if Jose Mourinho loses to Arsene Wenger for the first time on Sunday it won’t stop his side becoming champions. Next year, though, Chelsea won’t have it all their own way and no team is better placed than Arsenal to dislodge them. There is a different feel to their form and performances this time around and Wenger said recently he could ‘smell’ something happening. You just hope, however, Wenger and Arsenal’s board don’t get fooled into thinking they have got all the tools they need at their disposal. This is not the time to be complacent. This is the summer when Arsenal must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly-men. That is exactly what Chelsea did 12 months ago. After finishing behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Mourinho didn’t mess around. In came Diego Costa, who had spearheaded Atletico Madrid’s La Liga success, and a World Cup winner in Cesc Fabregas. They meant business. The money was big but the quality was proven and, after they were unveiled, everyone began tipping Chelsea for the title. We might be doing the same with Arsenal come August if Wenger, who has been criticised for spending Arsenal’s money like it’s his own, is similarly ambitious. Arsenal, it should be stressed, are not in need of major surgery and the spine of their team is now much stronger than at any point last season, when they only just held off Everton’s challenge to finish fourth. But there is still room for improvement. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger talks to his players ahead of extra time at Wembley last Saturday . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho looks in fine form during a press conference on Friday . Results have been impressive since David Ospina replaced Wojciech Szczesny, who had failed to show the required consistency. Ospina has played 12 Premier League games; Arsenal have won 11 and he has kept six clean sheets, but Wenger still needs to buy a new No 1 if they are to be title challengers. Petr Cech would be an ideal candidate to come in. Laurent Koscielny has steadied things in defence, with Arsenal winning 15 of the 18 games he’s played since January 1 but, to progress, Wenger needs another top centre back. Gabriel Paulista arrived in the New Year but it seems it was to provide cover for Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Francis Coquelin has added bite to the midfield, but would Arsenal have enough to challenge next season if Coquelin is their anchor and Mikel Arteta is his back up? No. Why doesn’t he go for Paul Pogba, who looks set to leave Juventus? Wenger spent £42m on Mesut Ozil, so why not spend the same and more on Pogba. If they needed to sign Ozil two years ago, their need to sign Pogba this summer is even greater. Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid is 29 and at the peak of his powers. He would be ideal at the heart of the defence. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina pictured during a training session at London Colney last week . Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech warms up before Saturday's Premier League clash against Manchester United . Olivier Giroud, meanwhile, has provided a focal point up front. I like Giroud. He is an under-rated striker and, had he not missed three months with a broken ankle, his tally would be more than 14; he averages a goal every 101.93 minutes, the second best rate in the Premier League. Giroud is one of a number of good options Wenger has up front. Alexis Sanchez has been brilliant, while Danny Welbeck has played his part, but that should not stop Wenger looking to improve on what he has got. If a forward with the class of players he has had before, such as Thierry Henry or Nicolas Anelka, comes on the market, Wenger would have to move for him. Imagine what Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero or Karim Benzema could do for Arsenal? I’m not saying Arsenal are getting to the levels of ‘The Invincibles’ but their form has me thinking they are getting closer. The 2-0 win at Manchester City in January could be a turning point. They made themselves difficult to beat rather than being open. Hopefully we will see more of this. Arsenal's French striker Olivier Giroud looks forward as he advances with the ball at Wembley . Danny Welbeck (left) looks to evade the challenge of Reading's Hal Robson-Kanu (centre) and Alex Pearce . Of course it has been frustrating that they have not challenged for the title since last winning it 11 years ago, and Wenger has not had a smooth ride. Fans turned on him after they lost at Stoke — and after the Champions League defeat to Monaco — leading to talk about Jurgen Klopp coming in. But some perspective is needed. Wenger has done a good job keeping Arsenal consistently in the top four — all their rivals have dropped out at some point in between — and by the end of next month, they could have won back-to-back FA Cups. How could you then get rid of Wenger? So one question would need asking: what are they waiting for? Both Manchester clubs will spend in the summer, but both those clubs have got far more problems to fix. City’s squad is old and needs big investment, while United will have the complication of being back in Europe. Wenger, then, could use the next window to call it on. The message it would send out to his players, fans and, most significantly, their rivals would be huge. It would let everyone know they were launching an all-out assault on the title. They would have to be taken seriously. Beating Chelsea on Sunday won’t alter things in the short term, but it will offer belief that Arsenal can challenge next season. What they do in the window will determine how big a statement they can make. Finding some special players could transform them. Borussia Dortmund head coach Jurgen Klopp celebrates after beating SC Paderborn last weekend . Wenger applauds the Arsenal fans after his side booked their place in the FA Cup final . Big guns missed out on a Fab freebie . Full marks to Aston Villa. They are a side rejuvenated by Tim Sherwood and absolutely deserved to beat Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Jack Grealish understandably attracted most of the headlines for his outstanding performance but the role Fabian Delph played was just as important; his aggression, energy and left foot gives Villa balance in their midfield. Liverpool couldn’t cope with his aggression. Earlier this season, Delph was lauded for committing his future to Villa even when their position in the Barclays Premier League was threatened. He signed a four-year deal, which showed his character could never be called into question. What can be called into question, however, is the wisdom of some other clubs in the Premier League. Fabian Delph (right) celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against Liverpool in the FA Cup semis . Delph, do not forget, was set to be out of contract this summer and a number of sides at the top of the table had their chance to sign a young England international for free. No doubt these same clubs will go out when the window opens and bring in at least one foreign midfielder, to go with the ones they signed last summer, and soon enough we will hear at some point next season that we don’t have enough English players playing for top sides competing in Europe. There will then be complaints from clubs saying it is impossible to buy English players because there is such a premium on them and they will argue that is why they are forced to look abroad for new signings. The Delph situation shows that sometimes such an argument is nonsense. He is now Villa’s captain and has been their best player for the last 18 months. His progress has been so impressive he is now a regular in the England squad and if he can add more goals to his game — like the one he scored against Liverpool — he could reach a very high level. Delph slots the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in Villa's 2-1 victory at Wembley . If Delph does maintain his improvement, inevitably clubs will come looking at him. But if they want him, it will cost. For reasons only they know, they let slip a chance to get something good for nothing. Their loss is most certainly Villa’s gain.","It is not unusual to see Arsenal finish the season with good results .

Slager said, after an iPhone ringtone was heard. Slager then appears to say: 'He grabbed my taser, yeah. Yeah, he was running from me.' His wife, Jamie, is eight months pregnant with their first child. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder on Tuesday. A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott . Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting . Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week . Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report . Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47. POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside . Williams, who has multiple criminal convictions, said that he was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and had his face stomped on during a 2011 arrest. He said he did not resist arrest . Scott was laid to rest on Saturday, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. Slager is being held without bail and faces punishments as serious as the death penalty if convicted. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter, leaves the funeral for her son in Charleston, South Carolina. The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians . Scott, who was remembered as a beloved father, had his coffin draped in an American flag during Saturday's funeral ceremony .","Audio has surfaced of Michael Slager, 33, laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the shooting .

A woman from South Carolina is suing Harlem tattoo parlor Black Ink, claiming an artist there did a botch job on a chest piece that left her disfigured and in pain. The Harlem tattoo parlor's owner and artists star in their own reality show, Black Ink Crew, which has had three seasons. Scroll down for video . Scarred: Asabi Barner, 37 (pictured), is suing Black Ink tattoo parlor in Harlem, New York City for a chest tattoo that left her scarred . The damage: Barner says she went to the parlor after watching the reality show which features the shop on VH1 . In pain: Barner said she trusted the artists, but came away with a tattoo that remains painful a year later . Asabi Barner told PIX 11 that she visited New York last year and decided to stop by the parlor to get a new tattoo to cover up a unicorn and horseshoe piece that she got when she was 18. She said she had watched the parlor's reality show and trusted the artists, who specialize in tattooing on dark skin tones. Barner left the shop happy with her 'phenomenal' new chest tattoo of fruits and vegetables to represent her career in the culinary industry. Reality stars: The owner and artists at Black Ink tattoo star in their own VH1 reality show, Black Ink Crew . But the next day she was still in pain and then noticed that the tattoo started to puss and ooze in the area around her left breast. Back home in South Carolina, Barner asked a local tattoo artist what was wrong and the artist said that her skin had been  'overworked' in an attempt to bring out a white color in the tattoo.  She also went to a plastic surgeon to see if the tattoo could be remedied, but the doctor said any procedure would only leave a bigger scar. More than a year later, Barner says she has to apply a ice pack to the tattoo every day to relieve the burning and itching pain. Photos of the botched tattoo show Barner's chest covered in raised scars that have left her uncomfortable in her own skin. 'In the intimate moments it creates a problem because you don’t have that confidence. I wasn’t overly confident before, but I felt good about myself. Felt good about my body, but it just changes you,' Barner told PIX 11. Barner is currently in the process of suing Black Ink, claiming the shop is responsible for her pain through reckless, careless and negligent behavior.","Asabi Barner, 37, of South Carolina got a tattoo at Black Ink tattoo parlor while visiting New York City .

c1db130d946d3c961edbaf9983c1ecb5e69629b8,"An NFL defensive back with a history of legal problems is being investigated after reports of an early-morning incident involving a physical fight and at least one shot being fired at a Texas club. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother are being investigated for aggravated assault after an altercation at a Dallas-area nightclub on Wednesday morning, according to reports. During a 2011 incident involving two guns when he playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Talib and his mother were accused of shooting a gun at his sister's live-in boyfriend in Garland, Texas. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother Yaqub are being investigated for aggravated assault . Talib was in trouble before and was wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2011 . During the latest incident, a shot was fired outside of Club Luxx in Dallas, Texas, after a physical fight inside . During the incident on Wednesday, Talib and his brother Yaqub had a physical altercation with someone inside Club Luxx and then a shot was fired outside around 2am, WFAA reported. When Dallas officers responded to the active shooter call, the man who called police said three black men had been involved in a disturbance and one of them had tried to punch him. The man also said one of the men pulled out a gun and aimed it at him before firing a round off into the sky outside the bar and causing 'an immediate panic'. The Talibs left the area in a Range Rover and a Jaguar and went to the XTC Cabaret. Police found the brothers at the second club and impounded the vehicles to look for evidence. The brothers were both questioned and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. The general manager of Club Luxx, confirmed the Talibs were at the club but denied that anything with a gun transpired, the Dallas Morning News reported. Hanney Kamal said: 'One-hundred percent that did not happen. 'I was there. Somebody might have called the police because there was a yelling argument. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract last year . 'It's athletes — someone sees them yelling and dials 911. 'Everyone was asked to leave the club, which they did of their own free will, and that was it.' Broncos vice president of public relations Patrick Smyth said: 'We have been in touch with Aqib regarding these reports and will continue to monitor this situation.' Dallas police falsely reported Talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last June during an NFL camp afterparty, the Denver Post reported. The police apologized after it ended up being Yaqub who was arrested. During the 2011 incident in Garland, felony warrants were issued for Talib and his mother Okolo Talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police suspected them both of firing shots from a Ruger .380 handgun at Shannon Billings, the boyfriend of Talib's sister, and also believed the NFL back attempted to pistol-whip Billings with a Springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident, the Boston Globe reported. They had apparently learned Billings was being physically abusive towards their family member. Talib, who owned both weapons. reportedly yelled during the pistol-whipping: 'You're going to make me throw away my career.' The charges were dropped because prosecutors believed Billings, a registered sex offender with the state of Texas, would not make a credible witness. Garland Police spokesman Joe Harn said: 'It was very fortunate no one was killed and no one was hurt seriously. 'There wasn't a great deal of distance from one person to the other that was shooting.' After the 2011 incident, a felony warrant was issued for  Okolo Talib for an assault with a deadly weapon charge . In addition to playing for the Broncos, Talib has also played for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Bucs . In addition to the gun incidents, Talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a Florida cab driver. He then resisted arrest on charges of simple battery. The shutdown corner also fought with teammates and was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract with Denver in March 2014. He also has played for the New England Patriots during his seven-year career. During his time with the reigning Super Bowl champs, Talib said: 'I'm a competitor on the field, man. 'That's kind of what we're talking about right now, just football.' If charges are brought with regard to the incident in Dallas, Talib could face discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history.

Luke has been missing for two nights in a Victorian national park, with temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius on Saturday night. However, he may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. According the Herald Sun, the 11-year-old was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen.

6559748e1c5dac470776d1ffc842973830d81da7,"Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme. They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused: Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that’s not where a large portion of the investors’ money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D. Allen in Davie, Fla., where Allen is said to live. A person answering the phone at Daub's home said there was no comment. They are not represented in the case by attorneys, according to the SEC.","Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner Susan Daub are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators .

The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

919e6284ad7e39b29f4e3aa3bf4cbb7277fcd5d3,"Lord Janner sent a ‘thank you’ Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday . Lord Janner sent a ‘thank you’ Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday. The officer said he was appalled by the Labour peer’s note after his superiors forced him to drop his inquiries into Janner’s alleged sex abuse. The note thanked him for how he had dealt with the issue, and even invited him and his wife to dinner at Parliament. The revelation of Janner’s apparent attempt to influence the police came amid fresh concerns about the Establishment cover-up of the Labour grandee’s alleged paedophilia. Detectives have carried out four child sex inquiries into Janner since 1991, but attempts to bring him to justice were repeatedly blocked. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders announced earlier this month that he should been have charged on each occasion. But she went on to rule that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia. The decision has caused outrage – with critics pointing out that he signed letters in the House of Lords as recently as this month, and had held numerous dinners and events in Parliament since being diagnosed in 2009. It has also been revealed that Mrs Saunders was a pupil at the same legal chambers as Janner – although she claims she never met him. The furore over her decision grew yesterday as it emerged that: . The policeman who led the original investigation into Janner in the early 1990s spoke yesterday of how he was ‘gutted’ after orders to drop the case came ‘from the very top’. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, said his team uncovered evidence supporting allegations that the then-Leicester MP used his home and a hotel to abuse a teenage boy. He said he and fellow investigator Mick Creedon, now Chief Constable of Derbyshire Police, were prevented from arresting Janner. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ruled that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia . ‘Someone higher up told us that we couldn’t just arrest an MP and it went no further. We were told that by someone senior, who I can’t name, but the order had to have come from the very top. I’m sure my bosses’ hands were tied,’ he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I was extremely frustrated. Janner should have been arrested. He was treated differently because he was an MP.’ Mr Ashby, 65, added: ‘The bit that really got me was that I later got a Christmas card in the post from Greville Janner. ‘The card was an official House of Commons Christmas card and was handwritten. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, received a thank you note from Janner . ‘It said something like “I was very pleased with the way you treated me” and invited me and my wife for a dinner at the House of Commons. I couldn’t believe it. My wife was disgusted, as was I. Needless to say we never replied and never went.’ The decision not to charge Janner in 1991 was taken just weeks after Sir Allan Green quit as Director of Public Prosecutions when he was caught kerb crawling in King’s Cross in London. His deputy David Gandy took over temporarily until a full-time replacement was appointed the next year. But Mr Gandy, 83, yesterday said he could not remember seeing Janner’s case file. He told The Daily Mail: ‘I have no knowledge of it whatsoever. It may well be the decision was taken by someone else in the department or it could have been sent out for senior counsel to make a decision on. Whatever happened I simply don’t have any knowledge of it.’ Even Janner’s barrister, the late George Carman QC, who was instructed to defend him after the abuse allegations became public in 1991, was astonished that he escaped prosecution. His son Dominic Carman said: ‘My father was surprised that Janner was not charged. ‘He suspected there may have been some attempt to influence the decision by the DPP, although there was no proof.’ Investigative website Exaro said the four experts who examined the peer had not all agreed on the six key points about the nature and extent of his illness outlined in Mrs Saunders’s statement on why she was not going to charge him. Janner’s family have issued a statement insisting he is ‘entirely innocent of any wrongdoing’. Lawyers for Janner’s alleged victims could demand medical tests to check the extent of his dementia. Child abuse campaigners have questioned how the former Labour MP was able to sign a letter to the House of Lords on April 9, just a week before prosecutors said he would not face charges because of his deteriorating dementia. Now it has emerged that Janner could be examined by experts as part of compensation claims brought by his alleged victims. Richard Scorer, of law firm Slater and Gordon, told the Observer: ‘I have certainly dealt with civil claims before where the alleged abuser has claimed to have dementia, and we have been able to have them medically examined in relation to that.’","Janner sent the card to detective after learning he would not be charged .

7232fcc05a31e8d0015dfcaa61e025bfea1f9627,"Kansas is one signature away from telling poor families that it's illegal to use their welfare payments to buy alcohol, tobacco and pornography, to visit strip clubs or tattoo shops, and to take vacation cruises or gamble on dog or horse races. Swimming pools, jewelry and lingerie stores, psychics, movie theatre, nail salons, massage parlors, bars and theme parks will also be forbidden territory for the first time, if Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signs a bill that hit his desk last week. The proposal would also give the force of state law to some of brownback's policies, including one that requires 'temporary cash assistance' recipients to hold down jobs, look for work or enroll in job training programs. NO BENEFITS: A pending Kansas law would make it illegal for welfare recipients to spend their government-supplied stipends at strip clubs, among a laundry list of other places . NO INK: Kansas welfare recipients who want taxpayers to shell out for their tattoos have until July 1 to experiment with the latest in body art . PARTISAN: Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback (center) is likely to sign the new measure despite strong opposition from Democrats . Kansans, like citizens of many other states, are issued debit cards when they register for state-based welfare. Under the rules of the bill passed in the state legislature, bail-bondsmen would no longer be allowed to accept the cards as payment. Recipients would be limited, for the first time, to withdrawing  $25 in cash per day. Liberal lawmakers complained that some welfare recipients use their debit cards to get funds for rent payments. Democratic state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau told the Topeka Capital-Journal that forcing those people to make multiple trips to bank machines to pay their bills 'is ludicrous. It is outrageous.' State Rep. Carolyn Bridges, another Democrat, complained during a legislative debate that putting limits on how the poor can spend taxpayer dollars says to them: 'If you are asking for assistance in this state, you're sort of less than other people and we're going to tell you how and where to spend your money.' NECESSITIES: Tobacco will be added to the no-no list, along with movie tickets, cruise vactions and lingerie . I SEE A JOB IN YOUR FUTURE: Fortune tellers and psychics? Out. Job training? In. CONFLICT: Republican state Rep. Kansas state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (left) insists that getting welfare recipients 'back to work' justifies the new law, while state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau (right) called it 'ludicrous' and 'outrageous' But state Sen. Michael O’Donnell, the Republican who gathered support for a House bill putting all the changes into place, said public assistance should be spent 'more responsibly' than it had been in the past. 'We’re trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended' – on food and necessities like diapers or toiletries, O’Donnell told the paper. The Brownback administration has signaled its support for the measure. It has already presided over a 60 per cent drop in the number of Kansans enrolled in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, known as TANF, during his first term in office. When Brownback became governor in 2011, the program served 38,900 people statewide. Today that number has dwindled to 15,500, according to statistics compiled by the Kansas Department for Children and Families. Numbers of food stamp recipients – a completely separate category of government welfare – have ticked down by just 6 per cent during the same period, however. Poverty rates among children have remained constant, according to the social-services nonprofit group Kansas Action for Children . The clash of statistics has raised questions about whether the state has actually been moving people off of TANF and into jobs. VICIOUS CIRCLE? Benefits recipients were previously permitted to spend their government money to bail themselves and family members out of jail . YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK: Until Brownback became governor, welfare enrollees could buy liquor with their benefit debit cards, but now his policy is likely to become a law that future pols will find it hard to undo . 'This is serious, good policy for the state of Kansas,' state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady, a Palco Republican, told the Associated Press. 'There's nothing better to get these people back on their feet than getting them a job and getting them back to work.' But Democratic state Sen. Laura Kelly countered in the Capital-Journal that 'we pat ourselves on the back that our TANF rolls have gone down exponentially and we say it’s because all those people are now working,' but 'we don’t know that and I’m guessing its not the truth.' Another Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Barbara Ballard, complained during a debate that telling welfare recipients that they can't use their state benefits to visit swimming pools would give the poor one fewer way to stay healthy. Republicans control both the Kansas House and Senate by wide margins. THe House vote was 87-35, and the Senate passed the bill 30-10. If Brownback signs the bill, it will go into effect in July.","'Temporary Assistance for Needy Families' funds can buy goods and services beyond food and necessities intended by program's designers .

f395b6856c979acfce8d0b0b48c3eb592cd5b0b5,"US officials are expected to stop prosecuting families of American hostages who communicate with kidnappers abroad or raise funds and pay ransoms. A National Counterterrorism Center advisory group, ordered by the White House, is expected to recommend what would mark a radical shift in US hostage policy, ABC news reported on Sunday. The NCTC interviewed families of hostages, including the parents of journalist James Foley, who was killed by Islamic State fighters. The family of a US contractor held by Al-Qaeda militants, Warren Weinstein (above), confirmed they paid a ransom in an attempt to secure his release which was reported in the amount of $250,000 . Foley's mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son, and warned that her family could face prosecution for doing so. The Obama administration has denied making any such threats. 'There will be absolutely zero chance of any family member of an American held hostage overseas ever facing jail themselves, or even the threat of prosecution, for trying to free their loved ones,' a senior official told ABC News. Meanwhile, the family of US contractor Warren Weinstein, who was snatched by Al-Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, confirmed it had paid a ransom to try to secure his release, which was in the amount of $250,000, according to CBS News. A spokesman for the family said it had 'made every effort to engage with those holding him or those with the power to find and rescue him.' 'This is an ordinary American family and they are not familiar with how one manages a kidnapping,' the spokesman added. Hostage James Foley was killed by Islamic State fighters. His mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son . 'As such, they took the advice of those in government who deal with such issues on a regular basis and were disappointed that their efforts were not ultimately successful.' It was unclear what sort of advice the family received from US government officials. Diane Foley welcomed the potential policy shift, which officials discussed with her last week. 'There's a lot that needs to be fixed,' she told ABC News. She said the past threats were 'the straw that broke the camel's back. It was incredible.' A number of hostage families expressed outrage after US Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was freed by the Haqqani Network in Pakistan a year ago in exchange for the release of five Taliban leaders held at the Guantanamo Bay military prison. Army Lieutenant General Bennet Sacolick, who previously headed the elite Delta Force counterterrorism unit, is heading the hostage policy review team, along with his NCTC staff.","Senior official said there will be 'zero chance' that family of American held hostages overseas will face jail or prosecution for trying to free loved ones .

In his newly-released police interview obtained by TMZ, Cle 'Bone' Sloan tells officers Knight uttered the threat then yanked on the gear stick. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to Sloan by ramming over them in his pick-up truck. Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records, has denied killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan in a parking lot in Compton on January 18. Scroll down for video . Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) told police Suge Knight (right) growled 'I'll kill you' before 'everything went black'. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to kill Sloan by running over them . Terry Carter (pictured) was killed, allegedly by Knight, in the Compton parking lot on January 18 . Sloan describes how the pair exchanged blows at the scene in January. 'He's mixing it up, he's f***ing with us and I caught him real good. Then he said, ""I'll kill you"". 'That's when everything when black.' Speaking to an LAPD officer, he claims Knight appeared to be reaching for a gun on the passenger seat while moving the gear stick. 'I don't if he was trying to put it in park or if he was trying to leave... I don't know. 'He started really reaching... when he said ""I'm gona kill you"", I thought ""oh sh** he's got a gun"". 'After that that's when everything kind of turned into a dream. I don't know what happened after that.' The audio release comes after pictures emerged of Suge Knight showing he had virtually no facial injuries when he was arrested. Knight was punched a number of times during the deadly confrontation, but close-ups taken by detectives show he only had a slight black eye. The images were released along with a number of key pieces of evidence as the court was shown footage of the deadly incident in Compton on January 18 for the first time. The footage, which was played by the prosecutor for the first time, shows Suge Knight's pickup truck (top left) pulling up to the driveway of a burger stand in Compton on January 29 . Just seconds later, there is a confrontation between Knight Cle 'Bone' Sloan and Terry Carter. Knight runs over Sloan's leg and then plows into Carter . Sloan is then seen lying on the ground in the aftermath. A bystander then runs over to help . Los Angeles Superior Court also released an image of the truck the rap mogul was driving when he ran over the two men . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen reviewed the items before determining Knight, 49, should stand trial on murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. The video shows Knight's pickup truck  pulling up to the driveway of the burger stand and Cle 'Bone' Sloan approaching the driver's side window. Sloan then approaches the driver's side window and punches the 49-year-old in response to a flurry of insults. Knight's pickup is seen backing up, throwing Sloan to the ground before the truck drives over his legs and then plows over Terry Carter - who died as a result. Among the other key pieces of evidence shown to the court were images of Knight taken immediately after his arrest. An hour-long interview with Sloan, who survived, describing what happened was also released. Coen ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation in late January. Knight has pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said Knight was fleeing an ambush by Sloan and others when he hit the men outside a Compton burger stand. The entire incident took approximately 30 seconds. The video, shot by a surveillance camera monitoring the drive-thru at the burger stand, continues until the arrival of a paramedic. The footage is likely to be used by both sides during Knight's trial. Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, has said the video appears to show an associate of Sloan's taking a gun off of him after he is run over, and jurors likely will be shown an enhanced version of the video. Knight turned himself in to authorities the morning after the incident. Detectives took pictures of him to try to show he did not have any serious injuries from the attack. Sloan's interview with detectives will also be crucial to the case since he is unlikely to repeat the lucid account of the event and his own actions that he gave investigators. In court on Monday, Sloan repeatedly said he didn't remember the incident and refused to identify Knight as the person who injured him, saying he didn't want . Another photo of the 49-year-old after he was detained was released by the court. Knight has pleaded not guilty to killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan.

5b07db7334509acd277ae7f5f605f5e6fbadf203,"Amanda Knox may have finally cleared her name, but eight years of legal battles have left the Seattle native penniless, exhausted and traumatized from stress, claims her biographer. 'In prison, she was threatened with rape from a male guard, it was a really terrible experience,' says Trial By Jury author, Douglas Preston. 'I think it has really affected her, it's really hard to lead a normal life after that.' Scroll down for video . Strain and relief: Amanda Knox spoke outside her parents' home on March 27 flanked by her fiancé Colin Sutherland after she was exonerated for the murder of Meredith Kercher in November 2007 . Three weeks after an Italian court overturned her conviction for the 2007 murder of British student, Meredith Kercher, Preston told RadarOnline that Knox is living out a bittersweet victory. 'She went to Italy as a normal 20-year-old, West Coast girl, a soccer player, rock climber, very naïve,' says Preston about Knox's ill-fated adventure to Perugia. 'So many terrible things happened to her in Italy, so many lies were said, and the online savagery directed at her, I've never seen anything like it.' So affected has Knox been by her struggle to be exonerated by the Italian courts, that Preston hinted to RadarOnline that she is suffering PTSD and seeking professional help. 'Anyone who has been through what she's been through is going to have issues. It's like a soldier come back from Iraq, having children shot in front of him, you've been through a horrific experience. If it doesn't affect you physically, it affects you emotionally,' he says to Radar. Family struggle: Amanda Knox stands on the front porch with her fiancé, her mother Edda Mellas and stepfather, Chris Mellas. According to her biographer, Knox and her family have spent millions fighting her conviction . On top of her fight to be declared innocent, Preston claims that Knox has been ravaged financially by legal fees. This despite receiving a reported $4 million advance for her 2013 book, Waiting To Be Heard. 'The ordeal has been hugely emotional, but the financial impact has been catastrophic,' says Preston. 'Amanda received a $4 million advance for her book, that money has all gone, immediately out of the door to pay legal fees and there is nothing left,' Preston explains. 'She really wants to establish that she's innocent in Italy, they've paid a lot of fees to Italian lawyers.' Knox, 27, fought the Italian legal system for eight years, spent four years in prison and went through three appeals until she and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito were exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in late March for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Shared experience: This split picture shows Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, arriving with penitentiary police to a court hearing in Perugia September 26, 2008 . Beginning of her nightmare: Amanda Knox leaves with penitentiary police after a court hearing in Perugia in September 2008 after she and her ex-boyfriend were arrested for the murder of Meredith Kercher . Kercher was discovered in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Kercher in November 2007. The British student had been stabbed four times and her throat slit in what the Italian courts claimed was a sex-game gone wrong. Knox and Sollecito was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to 26 years behind bars, but were acquitted in 2011. Knox immediutely returned to the United States protesting her innocence, but in January 2014, the Italian courts overturned that acquittal and reinstated the guilty verdict. However, the case ultimately went to the Supreme Court and their conviction was overturned. Tears: Amanda Knox breaks down after hearing she had been acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher in October, 2011 . Return home: Amanda Knox pauses emotionally while speaking during a news conference at Sea-Tac International Airport, Washington after landing there on a flight from Italy, October 4, 2011 after her acquittal . On the announcement of her innocence, Knox appeared on her Seattle doorstep to make a statement. Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas, sister, Deanna Knox, and fiancé, Colin Sutherland, the 27-year-old broke down in tears as she told the press: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' Amanda Knox could now receive millions in compensation after being cleared by Italy's top court of murdering Surrey student Meredith Kercher. The 27-year-old and her former lover Raffaele Sollecito both served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder in 2007. It is thought that Knox will return to Italy, despite having vowed never to, and will write about the country's legal and judicial system while she is there. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. Both Knox (above) and Sollecito could now seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison . While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito’s father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' She added that she was 'full of joy' following Italy's highest court's decision to overturn her murder conviction, saying: 'I'm incredibly grateful for what has happened. For the justice I have received, for the support I have had from everyone, from my family and my friends to strangers.' Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who has said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement, saying she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.'","Amanda Knox, 27, and her family have been left in financial difficulties by the fight to clear her name .

3b0a89947b49342cc8ab6a94c4a48f1c4776806e,"Cate McGregor was surprised when she was unconditionally backed by the cricket community and the Australian Army. But it was Tony Abbott's response to her transformation from man to woman that knocked her for six. It took less than an hour for the federal Liberal leader to call Ms McGregor after she forwarded the chapter of her book that outed her. Ms McGregor recalled that very moment - during her address to the National Press Club on Wednesday - when the prime minister told her 'it was okay'. 'I actually said to him ""your party won't be thrilled about this"",' she said, the ABC reports. However the senior military official did not express the same kind of appraisal when it came to Mr Abbott's stance on same-sex marriage, saying she is 'sad' that he is not a supporter of it. Scroll down for video . Cate McGregor - now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force - spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) publicly backed McGregor (right) by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman . Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says. 'There is a kind of a firefighter buried inside the politician still and he tends to barge into burning buildings if his friends are in there.' Mr Abbott publicly backed his friend by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman. Ms McGregor, now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force, spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm. In 2012, after years of drowning agonising pain with alcohol and drugs, McGregor stopped 'functioning' as a man and chose to live as a woman. She tried to resign from the office of former Chief of Army David Morrison when her transformation became public. He refused her resignation. 'It was easier to tell David Morrison I was transgendered than I was going to become an air force officer,' she said. 'I love the Army for that.' Mr Abbott sits with Ms McGregor to commentate during the International tour match between the Prime Minister's XI and England at Manuka Oval in Canberra last year . The senior officer addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series . McGregor a senior officer knows she's 'benefited enormously' from male privilege. But she'd willingly sacrifice it all to have lived as a woman from her early 20s. The cricket commentator, columnist and former staffer to Bob Carr, addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series. At times, she became tearful. But even through tears she had the room laughing. 'The hormones are obviously working,' she quipped. 'I guess if Michael Clarke had to cry during a eulogy, I get to do a weep.' McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said. 'There's no denying it, he has been vilified and become a hate figure to some extent.' And she won't attack him publicly, including his stance on same-sex marriage or his performance as minister for women. 'The one thing I'm not going to do is shop a friend for a round of applause.' The ABC did however report that she said: 'He's not a supporter of gay marriage, I'm sad about that.'","Cate McGregor is a Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force .

Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, has been arrested for felony murder and his brother Jean, 17, was shot dead after an incident in which the two reportedly tried to rob a group of Miami drug dealers. Their mother is Roxanne Dubé, who was only recently appointed to the role of consul general in Miami. Scroll down for video . Jean Wabafiyebazu (left) was killed and his brother Marc (right) has been arrested after a gunfight erupted during a drug deal on Monday . Their mother is Roxanne Dubé (above), the recently appointed Canadian Consul General in Miami . According to the Miami Herald, police believe the two young men were armed with guns as they tried to rob a group of men during a drug deal at a home in the Coral Way area. The boys had reportedly agreed to purchase two pounds of marijuana at a cost of $5,000, and driven to the house under the guise of making said purchase in their mother's BMW with diplomatic plates. Police claim that their plan was to then rob the drug dealers. Gunfire broke out soon after they entered, and Jean and Joshua Wright were killed, while Anthony Rodriguez was wounded. Marc was in the car when this incident occurred. Both Marc and Rodriguez were arrested under a Florida law that says anyone who participates in a violent felony that results in death can be charged with murder. Rodriguez has also been charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell. A second man was reportedly with Jean when he went to rob the drug dealers, though his identity is not known at this time.

He also said the boys kept to themselves, and did not have much of a social life. 'My wife told me they didn’t go out,' he said. 'They went to school, went home, went to school.'

b0c9590c6a048dc8f46629354634290d1d6b1b88,"A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim, Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza — who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France — was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center)  and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van.","Norma Esparza, 40, is facing six years in state prison after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter .

The man ran into bushland after police stopped a blue Hyundai Getz car on the Bermagui to Tathra Road in the Bega Valley, on the far south coast of NSW, just after 8.30pm on Wednesday.

c5f7779cc0b551221e803440b5104bdbb9225a5f,"Defense attorneys released some of the training records Saturday for a 73-year-old volunteer sheriff's deputy charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect in Oklahoma. The records for Robert Bates include certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Bates' attorneys said the 64 pages of information include records Bates, of Tulsa, copied and kept for himself. Although there are time gaps in the documents provided, some of the records seem to indicate Bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses. Scroll down for videos . Apology: Robert Bates became emotional as he apologized to the family of the man he shot dead during a botched sting operation on April 2. The reserve deputy appeared on the Today show on Friday . 'For the first time today, we feel like someone's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications,' Scott Wood, an attorney for Bates, said after the documents were released. Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Bates spoke at length about the deadly incident for the first time on the Today show on Friday, where he was flanked by his lawyer and family members. He also took the opportunity to apologize to the family of the man he killed in the April 2 incident. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said as he became emotional. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' The interview comes just days after Bates turned himself in to face charges of second-degree manslaughter. He was released after posting a $25,000 bond. On the Today show, he recalled how he had been in his car several blocks away when Harris, 44, ran towards him amid a botched undercover gun-sale operation. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after the man. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him. I'm sorry.' Mix up: While on the Today show, he showed where he keeps his Taser (left) compared to where he keeps his gun (right). He said that there have previously been cases of officers confusing the position of the two . The fatally-wounded man can be heard daying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' On the Today show, Bates said he was immediately hit by shock when the gun went off. 'Oh my god, what has happened?' he recalled thinking. 'This was not an intentional thing. I had no desire to ever take anyone's life.' He said that the shock remains with him and he is unable to sleep or concentrate. Bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his Taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right-hand side near his pants pocket. Today show host Matt Lauer asked him how he could make the mistake, when the two pieces of equipment are kept so far away from each other on the body. Support: He appeared on the Today show on Friday flanked by family members and his lawyer, right . 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates responded. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' The interview follows reports that Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had been allowed to 'play cop' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called 'unbelievably unfair'. Bates, who is among several well-to-do Tulsa residents who moonlight as reserve deputies, has purchased five vehicles for the police force. The Tulsa County volunteer deputy disputed earlier this week a Tulsa World report that sheriff's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records. Shot dead: Eric Harris, who is pictured with his son Aidan, was killed in the incident on April 2 . Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' The World said at least three of Bates' supervisors were transferred for refusing to go along with the requests, and said it consulted multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it gave no indication how those sources were familiar with the situation. Harris' family attorney — who had questioned Bates' qualifications as a reserve deputy — did not return a message seeking comment Saturday. A call to the district attorney's office rang unanswered, and the sheriff's office referred questions to Wood. 'I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that this allegation of falsified records is not true,' Wood said. His lawyer added that the report was largely based on claims made by a man who was terminated from the department seven years ago, at which point Bates had only been there a few months. Charged: Harris (pictured left) died from his injuries and Bates (right in his mug shot) has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. He faces four years in prison if he is convicted . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. But the sources who spoke to Tulsa World claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork. Bates faces four years in prison if convicted.","Tulsa County Sheriff's Office reserve deputy Robert Bates faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter for the April 2 shooting of Eric Harris .

d7af283e30d2bb5a9075f308849c4325a13a4af0,"Disgraced former CIA Director David Petraeus will not go to jail for giving his mistress classified material while she was working on a book about him, a judge ruled today. The former U.S. Army General, whose career was destroyed when the affair with Paula Broadwell emerged in November 2012, avoided jail time at the hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday and was instead sentenced to two years probation. He was also fined $100,000 - more than double the $40,000 his attorneys had requested. While Petraeus had agreed two months ago to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, he formally entered his plea during Thursday's hearing. Petraeus was wearing his wedding ring but there was no sign of his wife, Holly. He told the court he wanted to apologize to those closest to him 'for the pain my actions caused'. Apologies: Former CIA director David Petraeus apologized for his 'mistakes' as he spoke outside the North Carolina courthouse where he was sentenced to two years probation on Thursday afternoon . Sentenced: As well as the probation, he was fined $100,000 for leaking classified information to his mistress . Following the hearing, he briefly addressed the media outside the courthouse. 'As I did in the past, I apologize for those closest to me and many others,' he said, before thanking his supporters including his family, colleagues and fellow veterans. 'I now look forward to moving on with the next phase of my life and with continuing to serve our great nation as a private citizen,' he added. Critics have noted that in other cases concerning government leaks, defendants have received far harsher punishments than Petraeus. CIA analyst John Kiriakou who is serving 30 months behind bars for revealing the secret CIA torture program. Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represents Edward Snowden, told Reuters that he was not against lighter sentences - as long as such treatment is handed out equally. 'The problem is not that David Petraeus is getting lenient treatment,' Wizner said. 'The problem is that lenient treatment is only available to people in high places.' Petraeus was also given special conditions for his probation. He is allowed to travel internationally with his probation officer's approval, for example, and is allowed to possess firearms. He is allowed to pay the $100,000 fine $25,000 per month until it is paid in full. Going solo: Petraeus, who was seen wearing his wedding ring to  court, was not accompanied by his wife Holly to the sentencing hearing. It emerged in 2012 that he had been having an affair with his biographer . Petraeus has 14 days to file an appeal if he wants to dispute the sentencing. In the previous agreement, prosecutors said that while Broadwell was writing her book in 2011, Petraeus gave her eight binders of classified material he had improperly kept from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Days later, he took the binders back to his house. Among the secret information contained in the 'black books' were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus' discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors said. Those binders were later seized by the FBI in an April 2013 search of Petraeus' Arlington, Virginia, home, where he had kept them in the unlocked drawer of a desk in a ground-floor study. Prosecutors said that after resigning from the CIA in November 2012, Petraeus had signed a form falsely attesting he had no classified material. He also lied to FBI agents by denying he supplied the information to Broadwell, according to court documents. Affair: Petraeus gave his mistress Paula Broadwell, pictured together in 2011, classified material that he had improperly kept from his time in the military. She was writing his biography at the time . Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012. But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails. The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two. As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down, while in May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the relationship. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012 . 'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Petraeus held the CIA post less than a year, not long enough to leave a significant mark on the spy agency. The core of his identity has been a military man. He was brought in by President George W. Bush to command multinational forces in Iraq in 2007, a period when the war began to turn in favor of the U.S. Petraeus' command coincided with the 'surge' of American forces in Iraq and a plan to pay Sunni militias to fight al-Qaeda in Iraq. With American help, the Sunni tribes were able to push out insurgents and enable U.S. troops to withdraw in 2011. Those same Sunni areas are now controlled by the Islamic State group, which evolved from the remnants of al-Qaida after Iraqi's Shiite-led government proved weak.","The former U.S. Army General appeared in court in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday for his sentencing hearing .

Michelle Heale of Tom's River, New Jersey claims she was trying to burp Mason Hess when he began choking on his applesauce, but when she pulled him off her shoulder his neck snapped backwards, killing the boy. The mother of twins, who were in the next room when the incident happened and then just three years old, was charged with murder and endangering the welfare of a child after a medical examiner determined the boy died as a result of homicide caused by blunt cerebral trauma. The prosecution has argued that Heale shook the child to death. Scroll down for video . Michelle Heale (above) breaks down during her trial for murder in the death of 14-month-old Mason Hess on Tuesday as she reenacts the moments before his neck allegedly snapped . She claims she was burping Mason Hess (above) when he began choking on his applesauce and that his neck snapped when she took him of her shoulder . Heale was babysitting Mason as she was a friend of the family (Mason's mother Kellie above) and her husband Michael and Mason's father Adam worked together as detectives . NJ.com reports that on Tuesday Heale, 46, reenacted the moment the baby boy died with a doll. She claims the young boy started coughing soon after she fed him some applesauce on August 28, 2012, and when his passageway did not seem to be getting clear, she immediately grabbed him to see if she could make him burp. 'I hit him hard on the back. I may have hit him harder than I should have,' Heale said through tears after demonstrating on the doll. 'I hit him about four or five times, and then I felt the applesauce come out. I felt it on my shoulder and I felt it on my shirt.' Thinking the crisis had been averted, she took Mason of her shoulder. 'As I brought him down, his head snapped back ... he was completely limp,' she said. 'His eyes were open, but he wasn't doing anything. ... Everything was flopping.' Mason would die on September 1 after being airlifted to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Courtesy of Asbury Park Press/APP.com . Heale (seen above crying on the stand Wednesday) is out on bail during the trial and still has custody of her twins, who were 3-years-old when the incident occurred . Medical examiners determined that Mason (above with his parents Kellie and Adam) died as a result of homicide caused by blunt cerebral trauma . Heale took the stand again on Wednesday, as she detailed her relationship with the Hess family, with her husband Michael and Mason's father Adam both employed as detectives at the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office. For this reason the trial was moved to another county. The Heale and Hess families, including Mason's mother Kellie, had been friends for years. Heale spent most of her day expressing her disbelief over the situation, first being told she had to leave Mason at the hospital as she was suspected of hurting him and then being charged with murder. 'I thought they were going to take my kids from me because I was told that I had hurt Mason,' Heale said. 'I thought that once they were made aware that I had my own kids that they were going to take them from me.' Heale, who is currently out on bail during the trial, was able to keep custody of her children. She told the jury at the end of the day; 'I would never hurt Mason or anybody.' Heale's murder charge carries a maximum sentence of lifetime in prison, and a minimum of 30 years in jail with a 30-year period of parole ineligibility.","Michelle Heale of Tom's River, New Jersey is on trial for murder in the death of 14-month-old Mason Hess .

Two more games and Jose Mourinho will have confirmed his mastery of the Premier League with a third title in five attempts at the trophy and Chelsea will be crowned champions. The clue that this was the decisive game was in the manic nature of the second half. Not on the pitch, but on the touchline. Mourinho and his assistant Rui Faria were up and down with unusual intensity, even for them, waving players back with the most extravagant gestures when they lost the ball. Hold on to this lead, was the implicit message, and a huge step will have been taken to the ultimate goal. In fact, as One Step Beyond played at the end of the game and the players congregated in the centre circle, there was a sense that the celebrations were already in swing.

Two more games of course have to be won and that includes a visit to Arsenal next week. But there can be little doubt as to the destination of the title after this result. The hard work of the winter has been done. Mourinho was haveing none of it of course, rightly so, insisting they need eight points. They need nine, actually, to be sure, but beat Arsenal next week and then they will need just three more. ‘If the celebration is because we beat one the biggest clubs in the world, I understand that,’ he said. ‘If the celebration is because the players gave everything to win that game and they feel the result of the work they did this week, then I also understand that. ‘But if they are celebrating something more than that – not at all. It’s three points. Every point we get is one step in the title direction but no more than that.’ Yet though Chelsea were on the back foot for much of the game, though Manchester United did play well, the champions elect were worth their win not least in the fact that they were more or less in control of their destiny and they had the outstanding player on the pitch in Eden Hazard. When he nut-megged David De Gea for the opening goal, it was as though the race to be player of the season – they are both shortlisted for the award - had become a personal feud. The finish was both ruthless and decisive, an indication of how far he has grown. But he was not alone. The team approached their task with the cold, quite professionalism required of champions; not all titles are won at a canter with a spring in the step. Sometimes getting across the line is enough hand. Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera is sent flying by a tackle from Chelsea star Oscar on Saturday evening .

Lone striker Didier Drogba bursts past United defender Chris Smalling as Chelsea continue their pursuit of the Premier League title . Louis van Gaal felt his team, shorn of Michael Carrick, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind, deserved more. ‘I’m very proud of my team,’ he said. ‘We played the best match this season but in football you can lose in spite of you being the better team. ‘It's amazing how we have played here. When you have seen the statistics, it's unbelievable that the result is 1-0. We count it that we have made a big step forward in our process. But for the fans, they have lost. And Manchester United have lost. ‘We were always in our opponent's half. In spite of the difference and despite Chelsea's defensive organisation, we have created more chances. That's an unbelievable performance – but, read the score.’ Mourinho had the perfect riposte to that. ‘The game was exactly what we wanted. When we manage to play the game we want to play, it's fantastic. The game was exactly what we were working for the game to be. The team was fantastic.’ The truth was somewhere inbetween those two analyses. Mourinho would not have wanted the challenge Gary Cahill made in the final moments of added time, in which Andre Herrera trailed his leg into the clumsy tackle and fell. Herrera received a yellow card for diving – and Mourinho made much play of how his players might have been accused had they done the same – but another referee might easily have given a penalty.

Nor the moment when Shaw found Rooney in the fourth minute and the captain curled the ball wide when he really should have scored. That said, though United dominated midfield with Ander Herrera and Wayne Rooney, Chelsea had the better chances. Having conceded much of the possession, John Terry muscled Falcao off the ball – a foul according to van Gaal – and found Oscar on 37 minutes, whose impudent back heel saw Hazard set off like with an intent that would not be denied. His touch and finish was that of a man wholly sure of himself. Herrera then blotted his copy book, with a wayward pass on 53 minutes, seized on by Didier Drogba, sprinting goal-wards. Chris Smalling made enough of a nuisance of himself to ensure that shot was deflected over David de Gea. Hazard was on hand, tearing in at far post, but, unable to break his stride for a simple finish, he instead flicked the ball and hit the post. Nevertheless, you were left marvelling at the Belgian. He reminds you of Robert Pires when Arsenal were closing in on the title in 2002. It isn’t just that his speed terrorises or that his skill is above that of almost every player on the pitch. It is his state of mind that is so dangerous, that intuitive confidence great players possess; the knowledge that they have the capacity to change the game at any point. He did just that.

A Columbia attorney and former executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party has been arrested and charged with criminal domestic violence following an incident involving his wife last month. Todd Kincannon, 33, was arrested and booked into the Lexington County Detention Center on Monday evening. A bond hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. An arrest warrant alleges that Kincannon's wife, Ashely Griffith, told deputies that he grabbed her arm during a March 26 argument in their car, 'squeezing it tightly, thus preventing her from exiting the vehicle.' Griffith told police Kincannon threatened to kill her, himself and her family during the incident – threats he is accused of having made previously.

'I’m – I’m sick of it and I’m done with it. And I want to make very clear to you – I don’t give a sh*t about you, or about any of the sh*t in your life. I don’t give a sh*t about all your f*cking divorce threats. You have pushed me so far down the hole that I don’t care any more.'

Jeanetta Riley, 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014. The troubled Native American woman, who was addicted to meth and alcohol, had been taken to the hospital by her husband, 44-year-old Shane, following threats she made to kill herself, according to the Guardian. While parked outside of the emergency room of Bonner General Hospital, she pulled a knife from under the car seat featuring a three-and-a-half-inch blade, and was confronted by police before she was shot and killed. In the video, Jeanetta is heard in an exchange with officers as they repeatedly tell her to put the knife down but she refuses before a commotion is heard and they shoot her. Jeanetta Riley (pictured left with her husband Shane), 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014 . She was taken to hospital by her husband, Shane, after he heard her fiddling with blades and talked about killing herself and stabbing people (Jeanetta pictured above with her daughters Dayna, top, Dolly, left, and Hannah, right) Officers Michael Valenzuela, 27 and Skyler Ziegler, 29 were cleared of any wrongdoing following the incident and the case was closed in November. In the footage, Valenzuela, Ziegler and a third officer, Garrett Johnson, 23 arrived at the scene where Jeanetta was sitting in the car holding the bottle of vodka and the knife. She then walked towards them with the knife at her side, according to the Guardian. In the footage, Ziegler is heard shouting 'walk over here' and 'show me your hands' before she responds 'f*** you. no.' She is told again to put down the knife and continues to refuse and shouts 'bring it on, no.' Jeanetta then steps off the curb and into the road towards the two officers when gun fired is heard, with three bullets striking her torso and one striking her heart. Jeanetta took the knife from under the car seat and was confronted by officers who repeatedly told her to put the knife down but she refused (above scenes from the incident) After she stepped off the curb and walked towards them, they fired their guns and she was killed (above the moment she was shot) The events leading to the incident unfolded when the couple, who was homeless and living out of a 1996 Chevrolet van parked next to a lake, had spent the day with Jeanetta's daughter, 13-year-old Hannah. Jeanetta and Shane had arguments earlier in the day that were escalating when she began mentioning harming herself. The pair dropped Hannah off at her stepfather's house, and after drinking half a bottle of vodka while back at their camp, Jeanetta spoke about killing herself and stabbing people, Shane said. When he heard her fiddling with blades he decided to take her to the hospital. The Native American woman, who was addicted to alcohol and meth, and drank half a bottle of vodka before she was taken to the hospital on the day she died . In the summer of 2012, Jeanetta married Shane and two years later the couple gave up their newborn baby for adoption . Shane said he told Jeanetta at the time: 'This isn't a joke. It's not a game.' While parked outside of the emergency room, Jeanetta took out the knife and Shane ran inside and told a staff member behind the desk to call the police. Following the exchange with police, Jeanetta was shot and killed. Valenzuela told detectives he thought she was 'absolutely gonna thrust at me' when he pulled the trigger, while Ziegler said the knife looked 'huge in her hands', according to the Guardian. In November, the officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a local prosecutor. Fourteen hours after Jeanetta was shot and killed, a dog called Arfee was fatally shot by police in nearby Coeur d’Alene, in a killing that was ruled unjustified. His owner received an $80,000 payout two weeks ago as well as an apology from the mayor. Shane and Riley's three daughters so far have not even received an apology.

On the day of the incident, Shane ran into the hospital (above) and alerted staff to call the police .

He said: 'First of all, do nothing. Keep your distance, try to talk to her, don't even take your gun out of your holster, try to calm things down and work out what you're up against.' Reedy added: 'If they had not responded to the call they way she did, I truly believe she would be alive right now.'

2b1e66a3d683909ab2e213171eb7d673b24dcac3,"At his lowest point in the 1980s, Bruce Jenner wanted to flee to Europe for gender reassignment surgery and return to America as his children's Aunt Heather. That was around the time his young sons asked their mother why their father had breasts. As Diane Sawyer's explosive tell-all with Bruce came to an end last night, his second wife published a blog detailing their love affair, idyllic marriage and the gender dysphoria revelations that led to their divorce after two sons and a seemingly picture perfect Malibu life. Linda Thompson, now 64, met Bruce at the Playboy mansion when he was separated from his first wife, Chrystie Crownover, the mother of his two eldest children. They fell in love and got married in Hawaii when she was already pregnant with their son Brandon. A few years later they welcomed a second son together, Brody. Scroll down for video . Former couple: Bruce Jenner and Linda Thompson (seen together) met at the Playboy mansion. They fell in love and got married when she was already pregnant with their first son, Brandon. They later had another son . As Linda wrote on the Huffington Post, 'Those were the happiest days of my life. I had a wonderful husband, who was the most athletic, high-spirited, energetic, easygoing, manly man imaginable. I had two beautiful, healthy baby boys. I had two great stepchildren. Life was just about as good as it gets.' Bruce was travelling the world doing paid appearances and lived a glamorous life in Malibu, frequently seeing his elder son, Burt, and daughter, Casey, from his first marriage. But when Brody was 18 months old and Brandon was three, Bruce revealed to Linda the secret that he finally told the world Friday night. She was, she insists, blindsided. With a 'somber look' Bruce told Linda - who had braced herself for the revelation of perhaps an affair - that he identified as a woman. 'What do you mean you identify as a woman?' she recalled asking. 'What does that mean? And just as he told Diane Sawyer, Bruce told his wife of four plus years that as long as he could remember, he felt wrong with the reflection staring back at him in the mirror. According to Linda, her handsome husband told her, 'I have lived in the wrong skin, the wrong body, my whole life. It is a living hell for me, and I really feel that I would like to move forward with the process of becoming a woman, the woman I have always been inside.' She insists she never saw it coming and there were no signs. Family: The couple's youngest son, Brody (left), was 18 months old and Brandon (right) was three when Bruce revealed to Linda (center) the secret that he finally told the world Friday night - that he identified as a woman . 'Champion': On Friday, Linda, now aged 64, took to Instagram to express her support for her former husband . Unlike Bruce's third wife Kris, who walked in on Jenner in a dress, Linda says there was no evidence he had ever raided her closet or wore any women's clothes. 'No. Not a clue. Nothing. Nada. Never,' she said. The couple entered therapy after Linda found someone who specialized in gender dysphoria, and the doctor 'broke my heart into a million pieces.' She quotes the doctor as telling the couple of the sobering suicide statistics of transgender people at the time - 25 per cent committed suicide- and told Linda she could stay with Bruce as he became a 'she' or Linda could divorce him. But she couldn't change Bruce. While the couple was gutting it out in therapy for six months in a bid to save their marriage, Linda writes, Bruce was struggling. According to Linda, Bruce 'considered traveling out of the country, possibly to Denmark, to have the gender-confirmation surgery and then come back to the U.S. identifying as female.' With four little ones running around under the age of ten, she didn't understand how that would work. ''What about the children?' He thought maybe he could reenter their lives as 'Aunt Heather.'' While she says he referred to himself as Heather at the time, he never revealed his female name to Diane Sawyer, referring to that identity as just 'She'. As Linda writes, she sobbed endlessly and was despondent about the end of her marriage, but as devastated as she was, her 'heart bled for Bruce'. Linda decided she didn't want to be married to a woman, their marriage ended, and a few years later, she married music producer David Foster. In the years during and after the couple split, Bruce started taking female hormones. He detailed to Diane that period in the '80s, saying that the hormones quieted and calmed his mind, while his breasts grew to a size 36B during the five years that he was taking them. Linda remembers the time well, too, and also remembers the lengths he went to in order to change his macho facade. Tearful: Bruce revealed that he identifies as a woman in his explosive interview with Diane Sawyer last night . Transitioning: 'One day, after having spent a little time at Bruce's house, both boys came into the kitchen and said to me, 'Mommy, we saw Daddy getting out of the shower naked, and Daddy has boobs!' writes Linda . 'Thirty years ago the only hair removal that was permanent was electrolysis,' Linda writes. 'Poor Bruce began the process of having electrolysis performed on his heavily bearded face. He then began having the hair on his chest removed.' And she - and their children - couldn't miss his newfound bosom. Linda writes that she had an open door policy for Bruce to see his children, and he was welcome to visit Brandon and Brody anytime. But, and she doesn't detail why, the boys never spent the night at Bruce's house and occasionally visited. Most likely it was to shield them, as an anecdote about seeing their father undressed led to a lot of confusion. 'One day, after having spent a little time at Bruce's house, both boys came into the kitchen and said to me, 'Mommy, we saw Daddy getting out of the shower naked, and Daddy has boobs!' And so she tried to cover for Bruce, their father. 'Well, boys, you know how your dad was super-muscular and trained very hard for the Olympics? He had big muscles, and some of those muscles are called 'pectorals.' When you stop training and you stop lifting weights, sometimes the muscle turns to fat. So his pectoral muscles have probably just gotten a little flabby and look like boobs.' Soon enough, the exhausting coverup of his transition ended, and it wasn't Bruce's gender dysphoria Linda was protecting them from. Bruce stopped taking hormones, didn't go to Denmark, and started dating again. A source told ET he had his breasts reduced. According to Bruce during his ABC interview, he chickened out of going through with it and stopped taking the hormones. Linda then strongly hints that Kris knew more about Bruce's gender identity crisis than Bruce let on to during the Diane Sawyer interview. Support: On the Diane Sawyer episode, Brody and Brandon both sit proudly alongside their father, supporting him fully as he enters the next phase of life as 'She'. And their mother also wishes Bruce well . Linda's second husband David foster showed his support for Bruce after the interview. David was Brody and Brandon's stepfather for 14 years- including the time Bruce cut the boys off. 'Bruce dated several women, even though he had begun his transition and showed signs of it. He had no facial hair, no chest hair, and boobs, and he had gotten a nose job and trimmed his Adam's apple. 'Clearly he was still confused and conflicted as to how fully he was ready to commit to changing his life completely.' Then he married Kris and stopped seeing his sons, the sons who'd seen his breasts, for years. 'After Bruce and Kris married, there were periods of several years going by without Bruce attempting to contact or visit his sons. No birthday cards or phone calls, no ""Merry Christmas"", no ""Everything OK?"" after the big Northridge earthquake. Nothing.' But, in hindsight, Linda believes, the revelation of what her sons' father was struggling with, and running away from, in the years he vanished from their lives, helps explain a lot. On the Diane Sawyer episode, Brody and Brandon both sit proudly with their father, supporting him fully as he enters the next phase of life as 'She'. And their mother also wishes him well. Linda took to Instagram to support him on Friday, hours before the TV show aired, writing: 'Once a champion of Olympian magnitude...now a champion for those who share the struggle to just be who they are. #compassion #acceptance #tolerance #education #evolution #kindness #inclusion.' And she ends her blog, 'I can now breathe a little easier, knowing he now has found the strength and the courage to fulfill his dream.'

5e26542de023aacc067acc08be2378c58fcc518d,"An imam who was gunned down in the street in a murder that is thought to have links to terrorism had been replaced at his mosque by a Caribbean preacher involved in an attempted coup d'état 25 years ago. Abdul Hadi Arwani, 48, was found slumped in a Volkswagen Passat on Wednesday morning in Wembley. The imam, described as 'the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet', had gun  wounds to the chest. He was said to have been embroiled in dispute with his former workplace, the An-Noor mosque in Acton, where he had been replaced by Hassan Anyabwile from Trinidad and Tobago. The  name of Mr Anyabwile, 53, appears in Caribbean parliament documents surrounding a violent coup attempt in 1990 by Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeen. Hassan Anywabwile (left) from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Abdul Arwani (right) at the An-Noor Mosque in Acton. Mr Arwani was found dead on Wednesday with bullet wounds in his chest . Mr Arwani stepped down from his role at the mosque last year after it was repeatedly linked to extremism. When contacted, staff at the An-Noor Mosque refused to answer questions about the former preacher's time there . Over the course of six days, almost 100 members of the Islamic organisation were involved in holding hostages at gunpoint in the island's capital, Port of Spain. The city's police headquarters were blown up in the coup, with Mr Anyabwile described by a Parliamentary report of being 'responsible for organising the use' of the explosives involved. The coup ended after six days with the insurgents' surrendering on the condition of amnesty on August 1. Twenty-four people had been killed in the anarchy. It is understood Mr Anyabwile replaced Mr Arwani at the An-Noor mosque in Acton, West London, some time around 2013. He is registered as having lived in London since 2005. Mr Arwani stepped down from the An-Noor mosque last year following repeated accusations that it was linked to extremism. When approached this afternoon Mr Anyabwile, who became partially disabled after being shot four times in legs, denied any knowledge of any dispute. Anyabwile is named in a Trinidadian parliamentary report on an attempted coup which saw 24 people killed in 1990. He is described as being 'responsible' for the use of explosives in the blowing of police headquarters . Mr Anyabwile did not comment on claims Mr Arwani had been embroiled in a dispute with the mosque when approached . Arriving for midday prayers the man, who was helped into a wheelchair by a security guard, told the MailOnline: 'Feud? I know nothing about that. 'All I can say is from Allah we come, and to Allah we return.' When contacted today another member of staff at the mosque refused to answer questions about Mr Arwani's time there. A statement printed on a piece of paper and taped to its front door read: 'We have with great sadness heard of the unfortunate death of Shaykh [sic] Abdulhadi Arwarni who was the former Imam of the Annoor [sic] Cultural & Community Centre who served from 2005 to 2011, he will be sadly missed. 'We send our sympathies and condolences to his family, the Muslim community and friends. May Allah forgive him and open the doors of mercy onto him.' But one friend of the late imam said the dispute between the father of six and the An-Noor Mosque had been heated. Solicitor Mohammad Bassam Tablieh, 43, said there had been conflict about the 'running' of the mosque. There is no suggestion that either Mr Anyabwile or the An-Noor mosque in Acton is suspected of  any involvement in his death, with counter terrorism police still investigating. Scotland Yard officers called in the specialist division because 'of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. 'The investigation remains in its very early stages and officers remain open-minded about the motive,' a spokesman added. Earlier this week sources close to the Mr Arwani said they feared he may have been killed by supporters of the Syrian president Bashar-al-Assad - of whom the imam was a fierce critic. Describing his father as 'the most peaceful man you could meet,' one of his six children, Murhaf, said he was 'actively involved in the fight against extremism'. 'He did not care what your background, race or status was. He did not care if you were rich or poor. 'He just wanted to help people in need. He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it,' he said in a statement. Later his 23-year-old daughter, Elham Arwani, said while her father was openly 'against Assad', she did not think that was the reason behind his killing. Mr Arwani's family said they did not believe his death was connected to his opposition of the Assad regime. Speaking at the family home (above), his 23-year-old daughter said that was likely 'not the reason' Anyabwile was involved in the attempted coup of Trinidad and Tobago in 1990. Above, a rebel fighter stands with his AK-47 during the six-day standoff . Almost 25 years ago, around 100 members of the radical Islamic group Jamaat-al-Muslimeen stormed Trinidad and Tobago's Parliament in Port of Spain. They were demanding that the then Prime Minister, Arthur Robinson, resign and that new elections be held, accusing the leader of wild extravagance while, they said, its working classes went hungry. The rebels blew up Port of Spain's police headquarters and stormed a state-run television channel in a bid to take control of the Trinidadian capital. The Muslimeen's leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, appeared ominously on air during the first day of the coup attempt. Among one of their hostages was Mr Robinson. The Prime Minister was shot and beaten during the six-day coup. Violence and looting ravaged the city as all those who had been in the buildings when the Muslimeen stormed remained in their capture. On its sixth day, the rebels agreed to surrender on the condition of amnesty - releasing what remaining hostages they were keeping unharmed. They were all arrested and charged with treason but later released after producing copies of an amnesty that had been agreed when brokering an end to the coup. Anyabwile, formerly known in the Caribbean as Beville Marshall, is thought to have separated from the Muslimeen in 2001. Years later he was shot four times in the legs, leaving him in need of a wheelchair. He had tried to establish his own Islamist group, according to the Trinidadian press. In 2004 a local report claimed he had been turned down for asylum by the Home Office having told them that his life would be in danger if he returned to the Caribbean island. The attempted coup brought the island's capital to a standstill with looting and violence rife for days . But friends and neighbours claimed critics of the Assad regime had been targeted in the area, with some residents who displayed green flags, a sign of opposition to the Syrian government, having their tyres slashed. Mr Arwani grew up in Hama, the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the Syrian Army under the orders of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father. He fled the country as a 16-year-old, taking refuge in the UK while his parents faced routine questioning of his whereabouts for years. One of the mourners who gathered in his memory at Nadi Park Royal in Willesden Junction, north west London, said he had returned to Syria in recent years to dissuade fighters from aligning themselves with the Government. The source claimed Mr Arwani stopped going to the country on advice from the Turkish authorities. The An-Noor Mosque, where Mr Arwani used to be one of the main imams, has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers. It became notorious in 2013 when a terror suspect went there and changed into a burqa in order to escape surveillance then went on the run. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed has been missing for 16 months, and was last seen entering An-Noor dressed as a man before leaving in a full-length covering designed for women which obscured his identity. He was subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure, which restrict the movements of people suspected of involvement in terrorism. Other extremists linked to the mosque include Uthman Mustafa Kamal, the son of hate preacher Abu Hamza, who has regularly led prayers at An-Noor.","Abdul Hadi Arwani was found dead in Wembley on Wednesday morning .

30636044bd9f292fc28a54ee38af36da5a6f41ac,"The man named as a person of interest in the disappearance of William Tyrrell was living with three young boys at the time the toddler vanished - despite authorities being aware of allegations he raped two young girls in 1987. The New South Wales Ombudsman is investigating how Bill Spedding, 63, who has been charged with five counts of child sexual assault and two counts of common assault, was able to live with children despite claims being made against him. The mother of the three young boys, who cannot be named, was shocked to discover that the children had been living with a man accused of child abuse. 'Someone... needs to be held accountable,' she told The Australian. Scroll down for video . Bill Spedding was arrested and charged on Wednesday for the sexual assault of two girls  in Sydney in 1987 . The boys' grandfather told the newspaper: 'I am very concerned about what may have happened to my grandchildren.' During a short hearing on Thursday, a court heard Spedding raped two girls aged six and three in a caravan repeatedly nearly 30 years ago. Case notes held by the NSW Department of Family and Community Services detail the allegations of abuse, court documents show. While the Ombudsman confirmed it will be 'making inquires' into the accused sex offender's living situation, police are expected to lay more charges against Spedding and his alleged involvement in a paedophile ring. 'Investigations are continuing concerning such matters and it is anticipated further charges will brought against the accused in the foreseeable future,' the police fact sheet states, according to SMH. Spedding has denied any involvement in the disappearance of William, who was three years old when he vanished from his grandmother's Kendall home in September as played, dressed in his favourite Spiderman costume. The 63-year-old was a person of interest in the case of missing toddler William Tyrrell . Police emphasise the charges against Spedding are unrelated to the case of missing boy William Tyrrell, who disappeared from Kendall in NSW's mid north coast on September 12 last year. The disturbing historical crimes emerged after the washing machine repairman became a person of interest in the ongoing search for the three-year-old. Police will allege that, during a weekend in 1987, a three year old girl was sexually penetrated four times and assaulted in a caravan, according to the Daily Telegraph. Spedding was staying in a caravan on a property in Campbelltown in Sydney's west which was reportedly owned by his friend. In a victim statement the child, now aged in her 30s, claims she was either thrown against a wall or off the bed when she woke to found herself being raped. Margaret Spedding was pictured leaving Port Macquarie court on Thursday after her husband was refused bail . Detectives stressed that Spedding's arrest wasn't related to the four-year-old's disappearance . Court documents reveal that the mother and grandmother of the victim recall the three-year-old being greatly troubled by pain in her vagina and telling them that 'Bill did it', according to SMH. She was 'ill and continually vomiting' the following day and had 'extensive, black coloured bruising to her vagina and legs', according to the Daily Telegraph. At the time, the child sex assault unit at Westmead Hospital assessed the two children and determined that the three-year-old had been sexually penetrated in a number of ways. The six-year-old's injuries were also ruled to have been caused by penetration. Spedding's lawyer Robert Hoyles said the accused is adamant he is innocent and has done nothing wrong. 'One might say Mr Spedding will deny these allegations until his final breath,' Mr Hoyles said. Mr Spedding refused to take part in a formal interview at Port Macquarie police station on Wednesday night, according to SMH. This comes as police returned to the 63-year-old's home on Monday for a third time this year after it was unveiled that he was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the boy vanished . Spedding was arrested at his Bonny Hills home on the NSW mid-north coast at about 1.30pm on Wednesday . The court heard Spedding denied the claims when police initially put them to him in the 1980s. The case is only as strong as it was in 1987, Mr Hoyles said. He argued that to detain a man with no criminal record for such an historical matter when a trial was up to a year away would be a great injustice. However, the magistrate found Spedding had not shown cause as to why detention was unjustified given the serious nature of the offences and Spedding was denied bail. Despite the obscenity of the charges, Spedding’s wife Margaret supported him in court and they pressed their hands against the glass when he was refused bail, according to SMH. Mr Spedding applied for bail on Thursday but it was refused by Magistrate Thomas Hodgson. He will next appear in court on June 18. The 63-year-old was arrested at his Bonny Hills home on the NSW mid-north coast on Wednesday after five detectives descended on his property. His wife Margaret was in court as Spedding made his bid for bail. Spedding is believed to have said 'no' when five detectives asked him to go with them in the unmarked police car on Wednesday, Fairfax reported. While Spedding's wife, Margaret, was seen yelling at reporters during the arrest at their home. Just hours earlier, it was revealed that William's grandmother asked Spedding, a few days before her grandson disappeared from her garden, to fix her washing machine because she was expecting her family to stay over, The Daily Telegraph reported. This contradicts reports that her family's visit was unexpected. Spedding is believed to have said 'no' when five detectives asked him to go with them in the unmarked police car . Spedding was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the boy vanished. This week investigators visited Spedding's home for the third time this year before his arrest. It comes after police revealed they believe William may be alive, despite fears that he was abducted by a paedophile ring operating on the mid-north coast of NSW. Investigators believe the boy was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside . Police have visited Spedding's home three other times this year after becoming a person of interest in the case of the missing toddler . The parents of the missing three-year-old released new pictures of their son and a video pleading for his return by abductors who are believed to have snatched him in broad daylight last September . Investigators believe he was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside. The parents have urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers immediately on 1800 333 000. The release of the video comes more than a month since police scoured bushland in Bonny Hills, south of Port Macquarie, for evidence relating to William's whereabouts. Police divers were brought in from Sydney to search a murky dam in a bush reserve and a nearby swamp, after more than 30 officers and the dog squad had spent spent two days searching through dense bushland - including along a track that can only be accessed by four-wheel drive. The three-day search was carried out near Mr Spedding's home.

041ecfface8a0cdd65694d689f48ce2bf36dfffd,"An explosive new report reveals that the United States began secretly tracking phones long before the events of 9/11 or passage of the Patriot Act. In 1992, a Drug Enforcement Agency operation which has since been discontinued, monitored every telephone call made from the United States to one of the up to 116 countries on their watch list for drug trafficking, including almost every country in both North and South America. USA Today uncovered the details of the program, whose vastness was not known until now, and whose practices, especially in gathering bulk information, later became a model for the National Security Agency. Scroll down for video . It has been revealed the government began secretly tracking phone calls under a program created for the Drug Enforcement Agency in 1992 . The DEA program and its aims had been revealed earlier this year in a report from the Justice Department, though there was no mention of just how big the program was, and the amount of data the agency was authorized to gather. This is also now the oldest known example of the American government authorizing this level of tracking on unknowing citizens of the country. The goal was to infiltrate drug trafficking rings, especially those that were previously unknown to members of the DEA and federal government. The program also allowed agents to monitor calls the ruled out the possibility of foreign ties to the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building by American Timothy McVeigh. The program only recently shuttered, and was used for nearly two decades, with top Justice Department officials in four administrations - George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama - approving the data collections. The data collection did not however allow DEA investigators access to the actual content of calls, just the numbers dialed and time of the calls were all recorded. A 1998 request for Sprint to release their call records to the program labeled it as 'one of the most important and effective Federal drug law enforcement initiatives.' The program was eventually halted not because it had run its course, but rather out of fear for public response should the details be revealed. That decision came from Attorney General Eric Holder in September 2013, just months after Edward Snowden began systematically releasing classified information he obtained while working at the NSA, most notably documents that detailed the agency's reach, which while viewed by some as crucial and necessary, was seen by many as an Orwellian nightmare, specifically as it pertained to the freedoms and allowances the agency had been granted when it came to spying on Americans. The DEA confirmed this, and they now send subpoenas on a daily basis to telephone companies to obtain records. Former officials who worked at the agency prior to and during the program's inception speak of it as a necessity at the time as they attempted to combat the seemingly untouchable and infallible Colombian drug cartels. In that regard the program was a massive success, allowing agency officials to take down larger members of drug organizations thanks to a system that no longer required them to reach out to the phone companies every day, where the could only request individual phone records. And this years before the program had begun, and the agency was working with just the principles they had developed, two supercomputers and a team of analysts. Officials could not reveal those the program helped the agency to capture, but we do know that Colombian barons Carlos Lehder, Griselda Blanco and Daniel Barrera Barrera, also known as El Loco, were all captured by or with the help of the DEA in the years prior to the program. The success of this new system impressed President George H.W. Bush, who spoke of the idea of 'sophisticated intelligence-gathering and Defense Department technology' in a 1989 speech, the first time these concepts had been mentioned by a president. Those successes were short lived however, and just three years later drug crimes were hitting record highs while also turning increasingly violent, especially in Miami. It was around this time that the DEA program was approved, with President George H.W. Bush, along with Attorney General William Barr and chief criminal prosecutor, Robert Mueller, giving the agency these new data collection privileges in the final months of his first term. The report did not reveal when exactly this happened, and if he granted this before or after his failed bid for reelection. The DEA, who just years earlier were reaching out to phone companies in search of individual records, would now receive phone company records on a daily basis thanks to a request from the Justice Department. What's more, whereas before the focus was on getting records only of those who were known drug suspects due to time constraints, the agency now received a list of every single phone call from an American phone line to a country on the drug watch list. The countries changed, with some coming on then going off then coming on again, but the data as always the number and time of the call. There was push back from some of the telephone companies at the time, but never to the point that any of them challenged the subpoenas in court. They may have also seen no point in challenging these subpoenas in a court when those companies that did show hesitation received a letter from the Justice Department 'urging them to comply.' The aforementioned letter to Sprint in 1998 was an example of these notes sent to the phone companies, and given the fact that six years later there was still unease about turning over these records it would seem this was a constant battle throughout the years the program was active. That same letter provides another look at why going to court may have seemed pointless, as the Justice Department wrote that the program was 'legally appropriate' in the note, penned by then deputy assistant attorney general Mary Lee Warren. The scope of what the records could be used for was heavily checked prior to 9/11, with all the data being used to investigate drug investigations, with the exception of a few incidents that were seen as potential threats to national security, like Oklahoma City. With the program now shuttered, there are some concerns about the list of countries on the DEA list being revealed, though officials said that in many cases they were aware of the program, which would likely be just as beneficial to them as to the United States. The information was also passed along to foreign governments who in turn used it in building their own cases and investigations.","It has been revealed the government began secretly tracking phone calls under a program created for the Drug Enforcement Agency in 1992 .

However, medical professionals insist the resource shortage will not affect the immunisation programs for babies, children and pregnant women. It comes less than a month after the death of 32-day-old Riley who died after contracting whooping cough. His parents Catherine and Greg are now leading a campaign, urging adults to vaccinate themselves and their children to prevent more infant deaths from the terrible disease. The adult whooping cough vaccine will not be available in Australia until July, according to ABC News. However, although whooping cough is less severe in adults, infected adults do pose a serious risk for infants and children who are not vaccinated. Scroll down for video . Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised . Riley's father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his 'darling little angel Riley' 'The one product that is in short supply is not part of the formal national immunisation program, but is a booster dose that's used generally by GPs for adults,' Queensland Health senior medical officer Dr Alun Richards told ABC News. 'We have sufficient stocks to vaccinate children as part of the school-based vaccination program.' On March 15, two days before baby Riley died, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough. 'If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at (Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital). Please keep him in your thoughts!,' she wrote. 'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Riley's father Greg added. Dr Richards could not confirm why the shortage has taken place but told ABC that it is not abnormal. His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 'I don't know whether it's because of increased demand in the world or if it's another issue, but there are vaccination shortages from time to time,' he said. 'There are other preparations on the market [and] they're not all in short supply.' For people opting to be vaccinated against whooping cough, they may be deferred by their GP until more supplies are available. 'These people can return when supplies are again available,' Dr Jeannette Young told ABC News. Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. 'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.' Whooping cough (also known as 'pertussis') is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother's antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It's very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it's usually not as serious. Symptoms . The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: . These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the 'whoop' sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing. Information supplied by HealthDirect.gov.au . In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said.

A married mother of two battling cancer  whose removal from an Alaska Airlines flight caused outrage online said on Wednesday that the carrier refunded her family's airfare, which will be donated to research. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been viewed thousands of times. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.' Homeward bound: The married mother of three, her husband (right) and their two sons were returning home to California Monday after vacationing in Hawaii when they were kicked off the flight .

Brought to tears: As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up . The Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor. In Sedway's video, her husband dressed in a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats while his wife narrates their removal from the flight. 'All these people are waiting, and I am being removed as if I'm a criminal or contagious because I have cancer,' she says. 'My family is being forcibly removed from an airplane because I have cancer and no note to fly.' As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up. One of the passengers tells the woman, 'God bless you.' In an interview with NBC Bay Area, Elizabeth Sedway said the airline was concerned she might collapse during the eight-hour flight to San Jose, California. After being asked to leave the plane, Mrs Sedway emailed her oncologist in California and he gave her the green light to fly, but she told the local NBC affiliate in a phone interview that the airline was not satisfied and refused to let her re-board. The Sedways spent Monday night in a hotel in Maui, for which they were forced to pay out of pocket, and they were scheduled to return home on a Hawaiian Airlines flight Tuesday evening. Elizabeth Sedway lamented on her Facebook page that because of the delay caused by Alaska Airlines, she will miss two chemotherapy sessions, her husband will miss important meetings and her sons will miss school. Named and shamed: Sedway shared this photo of Alaska Airline staff at Lihue Airport on her Facebook page, identifying them as the employees whom she had to deal with during the incident . Damage control: Alaska Airlines later apologized to the family for mishandling the situation . Earlier Tuesday, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told CBS San Francisco that the company apologized to Elizabeth Sedway for the inconvenience and for the way its employees handled the situation. ‘Her family's tickets have been refunded and we will cover the cost of her family's overnight accommodations in Lihue,' Alaska spokeswoman Halley Knigge stated. 'While our employee had the customer’s well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.' Alaska Airlines apologized for the incident but said the employee had Sedway's health in mind. 'We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced Monday,' Knigge said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. Sedway posted on her Facebook page on Wednesday that the 'silver lining' of her family's experience would be that the value of their airline tickets would go to study the blood cancer multiple myeloma, for which she is being treated. She wrote 'Our family talked during the flight home from Hawaii, and decided how we wanted this situation to conclude. As with most unpleasant times, there are silver linings, if we're determined to find them. Here, we plan to donate the airfare, to be refunded by Alaska Airlines, to the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation – MMRF.

Pamela Anderson was all smiles as she joined Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to serve vegetarian meals to inmates at the Maricopa County Jail, making it the first jail in the country to go entirely vegetarian . Inmates are served a peanut butter sandwich with oranges and some crackers for brunch and a hot meal comprised of different vegetable and soy dishes for dinner. Anderson, a longtime vegan and a spokeswoman for the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said she hopes the meal initiative stands as a model for prisons and jails across the country. Anderson and PETA have came under fire for their association with the polarizing Arpaio, who has long faced criticism that he unfairly targets minorities for law enforcement. He has described himself as an 'equal opportunity guy, I lock up everybody.' PETA’s Senior Vice President Dan Mathews told ThinkProgress that the food he saw and tasted during a tour of the food factory plant last month was healthy. 'I was incredibly impressed to see the fresh produce,' he said. But a Fox News affiliate reporter who visited in 2013 commented that the carrots in the stew were brown and that the soy looked like 'wood chips.' Anderson and PETA have came under fire for their association with the polarizing Arpaio, who has long faced criticism that he unfairly targets minorities for law enforcement . Anderson, dressed in a red and black stripped top, signed autographs for inmates as she toured the prison which includes an outdoor area known as Tent City . Arpaio responded, 'Oh, that’s probably just dirt. Don’t worry about that.' Inmates, who receive just two meals a day, have previously called the food being served as 'slop.' The stunt at Maricopa County Jail on Wednesday as described as 'a new low for PETA' by ThinkProgress. Anderson, dressed in a red and black stripped top, signed autographs for inmates as she toured the prison which includes an outdoor area known as Tent City. An outdoor jail with electric fencing, Tent City can hold more than two thousand immigrant detainees. Because the heat can rise to 137 degrees during the summer months, the tent structure serves primarily as brutal physical punishment. 'We're saving a lot of lives and I think it's very helpful and encouraging to get people to eat compassionately and make non-violent choices,' said Anderson. Anderson, a longtime vegan and a spokeswoman for the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said she hopes the meal initiative stands as a model for prisons and jails across the country . A press conference at Tent City came to an abrupt end when reporters asked the sheriff to compare the $200,000 meat-free savings to the $14 million the agency is spending to comply with a court order that found sheriff's deputies discriminated against Latino residents. 'It's comparing apples to oranges,' Arpaio said. 'We won't be getting into that today, thanks very much.' An appeals court on Wednesday upheld key findings in the 2013 ruling that deputies under Sheriff Arpaio systemically committed racial profiling of Latinos. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the previous ruling by District Judge Murray Snow that unconstitutional practices targeting immigrants had extended traffic stops in the Phoenix area. The decision by Snow marked the first time that the sheriff's office known for immigration enforcement had been found to have racially profiled people. The judge is requiring Arpaio's officers to video-record traffic stops, collect data on stops and undergo training to ensure they aren't acting unconstitutionally.

edde10e6f363ca41b2440d3e5fc1bfb346b43798,"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered their 8-year-old son and permanently maimed their 7-year-old daughter, but Bill and Denise Richard do not want to see him executed. In a moving op-ed for the Boston Globe, published just a day after the two-year anniversary of their son Martin's death, the Richards have asked that Tsarnaev  be spared the death penalty so that they can finally get closure on the darkest chapter of their lives. Last week a jury found Tsarnaev guilty on all counts related to the April 15, 2013 attack on the Boston Marathon finish line. The penalty phase of the trial starts next week, in which the jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Scroll down for video . No to execution: The family of Boston Marathon bombing victim Martin Richard wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe, saying they oppose the death penalty for convicted terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The family pictured above on Tuesday, the two-year anniversary of the attack. Clockwise from top left: Denise Richard, Bill Richard, Henry Richard and Jane Richard . Victim: Martin Richard died at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, after the Tsarnaev brothers set off twin pressure cooker bombs . While the Richards say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their 'tireless and committed' work to bring justice, they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21-year-old to jail for the rest of his life. 'We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives,' the Richards wrote. 'We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.' They say sentencing Tsarnaev to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims. 'As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours. The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family,' they wrote. The Richards brought their three kids out to watch the Marathon two years ago, and were standing just steps away from where Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan (who died in a shootout with police a few days later) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs. Little Martin died in the blasts and his sister Jane lost a leg. Death or prison? Last week, a jury found Tsarnaev (center) guilty on all charges related to the attack. Next week marks the beginning of the penalty phase of the trial in which the jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison. Tsarnaev pictured above in a court sketch from April 6 . Moments before: Martin Richard is seen circled in blue on the day of the Marathon. Behind him walks Tsarnaev, carrying a backpack believed to have held one of the two bombs . During the course of Tsarnaev's trial, photos were shown in court of the moments before he dropped off a bomb in a backpack, strolling just behind the Richard family lined up against a gate at the finish line. On Tuesday, the Richard family revisited the finish line to take part in a memorial. The family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony. The Richards aren't the first to speak out against the death penalty in Tsarnaev's high-profile trial. The Boston Globe editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Tsarnaev should 'die in prison'. The death penalty is outlawed in Massachusetts, where the trial is taking place, but since Tsarnaev is being judged in federal court, execution is still a sentencing option. However, experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison, considering the state's generally liberally view on the controversial issue. Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney is Judy Clarke, a woman who specializes in helping high-profile clients like the Unabomber escape the death penalty. Clarke and the rest of Tsarnaev's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother's terrorist plot. All together: Above, Bill and Denise Richard pictured with their three children before losing Martin (bottom right) in the bombing . Brothers: Tsarnaev's (right) defense attorneys have tried to paint him as secondary in a plot orchestrated by his more extreme older brother Tamerlan (left).  Tamerlan died a few days after the bombing in a shootout with police .","Bill and Denise Richard wrote an op-ed opposing the death penalty for Tsarnaev in the Boston Globe on Thursday .

41b63c8625bcf2ecce22a02653d06bf4fa059764,"Another day at Melwood, another awkward conversation with Brendan Rodgers for Raheem Sterling. This time, rather than a chat about a contract spurned it will be a noxious but legal substance once tried and tested by our own Prince Harry that will be under discussion. If Sterling has any sense, he won’t use the distinguished list of those who have previously tried nitrous oxide as an attempt at mitigation. Once again the 20-year-old Liverpool forward has been rather stupid. For Sterling the life lessons are arriving thick and fast. What will perhaps stand rather more impressively in his favour is some of the football Sterling produced in this rather important win for Liverpool. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener in the first half at Anfield . LIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Mignolet 7; Johnson 6, Lovren 5, Can 6.5, Moreno 6; Henderson 7, Allen 6.5, Lucas 7; Ibe 6 (Borini 58, 6), Coutinho 7.5 , Sterling 7 (Lambert 89).

Ratings by Ian Ladyman at Anfield . Raheem Sterling cuts in from the left to score. Click here for more from Match Zone . There was a moment, just before the hour, when Sterling actually contributed one of the misses of the season. It was one of those he would probably have struggled to do again if he tried. Much earlier in the piece, however, when his team were desperate for a good start, Sterling scored the kind of goal that few can score. It is this that motivates Rodgers as he tries to navigate a way through the current difficulties of the contract negotiations. It is this, and other moments like it, that convince managers like Rodgers that players like Sterling are worth the trouble. For be assured, this was an important win for Liverpool and an important performance. Newcastle may be among the Barclays Premier League’s most compliant current opposition but Liverpool’s own football has been patchy recently. They have an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday and needed victory here to bring momentum and to take them to within four points of Manchester City, the team now occupying the final Champions League position. When the stakes are high, then, you need your best players and here, after some modest recent form of his own, Sterling pitched in early and emphatically. Both sets of players stand for a minute's silence to remember the 96 Liverpool fans who died in 1989 . The minute's silence was impeccably observed by both sets of fans before the match . Captain Jordan Henderson supplied the ammunition with a crossfield pass struck arrow straight to his team-mate over 40 yards. Sterling’s first touch was perfect but then we expect that in the Premier League these days. What followed was even better, though, as he eased inside Ryan Taylor and Daryl Janmaat before striking a perfect right-foot shot to Tim Krul’s left with his instep. Sterling was in total control of events from the moment Henderson’s pass arrived and it was terrific to watch. With centre forward Daniel Sturridge injured again, Sterling once again was crucial to his team’s attacking play. This time he was stationed on the left of a front three that featured Jordan Ibe on the right and Philippe Coutinho through the middle. For a while — for about 30 minutes — Liverpool were excellent and Newcastle struggled to cope. Coutinho was his team’s best player, as he was all night, and he could have scored twice while Sterling brought a low save from Krul from an angle, as indeed did left back Alberto Moreno. The key to it was that Liverpool were playing football that was relaxed and for that they owed much to Sterling’s goal. They should have scored at least one more — maybe two — during this period of dominance. Coutinho was a menace while at the base of the midfield formation Lucas Leiva was playing well enough to make Steven Gerrard fret over the team selection when he is freed from suspension at Wembley this weekend. Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as a hapless Krul picks himself up from the Anfield turf . Newcastle's defence begin their inquest Lucas runs over to celebrate with the England man . Liverpool players celebrate in unison as they looked to close the gap on Manchester City . When goals don’t arrive, though, things can go wrong and, for 10 minutes either side of half-time, that suddenly looked as though it might happen here. In the 10 minutes before the break Newcastle should have had a penalty when the dreadful Dejan Lovren tripped Ayoze Perez, while the Newcastle forward brought a superb save from Simon Mignolet. Midfielder Mehdi Abeid also threatened twice from 18 yards. Into the second half and, briefly, this surprising pattern continued. Lovren almost disabled his own team-mate Emre Can by standing on his foot and then slashed wildly at a clearance. Mignolet, meanwhile, punched a corner clear under pressure and was happy to see a low drive from Abeid hacked clear by a defender. Dejan Lovren, who was lucky not to give away a penalty, challenges Newcastle forward Ayoze Perez . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre), suspended for the match, watches on from the stands . Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Sterling inexplicably skews his shot wide in the second half when it looked easier to score . Sterling can't believe he has missed as Krul gets up to gather the ball for the restart . Sterling shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers after he was substituted for Fabio Borini in the second half . At this point the game, despite early indications, was in the balance and it was then that Sterling fluffed his lines when handed the chance to settle it. Happily for him, Joe Allen did manage to convert the vital second goal not long after. Sterling’s miss really was spectacular. Another raking cross from Henderson was miscued by Taylor in front of his own goal and when the ball broke for Sterling on the six-yard line it seemed he couldn’t miss. Remarkably he did and, on another night, Krul may have been tempted to offer him a high five in the tunnel. As it was, Allen’s subsequent goal was timely. Newcastle failed to clear a corner properly with 20 minutes left and when Allen’s weak header came back to him off Taylor the Welshman hooked the loose ball high into the corner of the net. Joe Allen watches as his second-half effort beats Krul to double Liverpool's lead and earn them some breathing space . Allen is mobbed by his team-mates after securing three points for Liverpool that closed the gap on Manchester City . With the result settled there was still time for Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko to get himself sent off. Riled by a spat with Glen Johnson, Sissoko clattered into Lucas and received a second yellow card. In truth, he was lucky it was not a straight red and, as club captain, he will doubtless face a few harsh words from his manager on Tuesday morning. It appears that Sterling, in that regard, will not be alone. Moussa Sissoko lunges in on Lucas Leiva with an ugly late challenge to earn a second yellow card .

c5921be42ba8e821cc6f2dee60d64da41481cec8,"A 13-year-old boy who was allegedly locked in a basement for 11 days has testified against his father and stepmother in court, saying his home was a 'very terrible' place where he was often beaten with a plastic pipe, forced to rise before dawn for workouts and isolated from other children. He revealed his treatment was so horrific, he attempted suicide in a bid to escape his parents' torture. Taking the stand against Charlie Bothuell IV and Monique Dillard-Bothuell on Tuesday, Charlie Bothuell, who was 12 when he was found in the basement, described the horrors of his home life. 'It was a very terrible place to be,' he told the court of his family's Detroit townhouse. 'I was expected to do everything perfectly. I was never given any leeway, to make a mistake and learn from it.' Charlie, who wore glasses, a white shirt, a tie and black pants for his hour-long testimony, was speaking publicly for the first time since he was found in his family's cluttered and dirty basement. Scroll down for video . Testimony: Charlie Bothuell (pictured), now 13, was found in the basement of his family's Detroit townhouse last June following an 11-day search. On Tuesday, he testified in court against his father and stepmother . Basement: Taking the stand against Charlie Bothuell IV and Monique Dillard-Bothuell on Tuesday, Charlie, who was 12 when he was found in the tiny, dirty basement (pictured), described the horrors of his home life . 'Weapon': He said his home was a 'very terrible' place where he was beaten with this plastic pipe (pictured being presented as evidence in court), forced to rise before dawn for workouts and isolated from other kids . Police officers who dramatically rescued the youngster on the eleventh day of a wide-scale search for him also found a blanket, cereal box, drinks bottles and a bowl of chicken bones in the tiny room. The hearing is meant to determine if there is enough evidence to send Bothuell IV and his partner to trial on charges of torture and child abuse. A 36th District Court judge will make the decision. During Tuesday's testimony, Charlie did not look at the prosecutor as he described how he was educated at home from 2012. His daily routine involved waking up at 5am for a protein shake. He was then forced to endure vigorous workouts that lasted up to two hours, followed by a shower, math and science lessons with old books, chores and another workout, he told the court. 'What would happen if you didn't do this routine?' asked the prosecutor. Charlie replied: 'I would get in trouble, a whipping.' The youngster said he tried to run away aged 11, but police found him. After he was returned home, 'I was told to basically lay across the dining room table and was spanked on the butt with a wooden stick and then a plastic PVC pipe,' Charlie told the court. Accused: 'It was a very terrible place to be,' Charlie said. 'I was expected to do everything perfectly. I was never given any leeway, to make a mistake and learn from it.'

Charlie's face was not pictured by the press as he gave his testimony; only his hands were shown (above) He recalled other 'whoopings' with sticks and pipes, which would cause the skin on his buttocks to bleed and 'split open'. 'Why did you lay over the dining room table,' the prosecutor asked him. According to Fox 2, Charlie replied: 'Because I was told to. (I) laid over the dining room table and I would be basically smacked on the butt.' The prosecutor then inquired: 'With what?' 'A wooden stick,' Charlie said. 'Then a plastic PVC pipe.' He added that his stepmother would sometimes punch him - and once even choked him. He was left feeling depressed and upset. The expectations about life at home were ""absolutely ridiculous', said Charlie, detailing how was made to stand in the corner with his arms held above his head if he did not complete assignments. 'They decided when they wanted me to stop. It was so painful,' he said. He added that he even attempted suicide in a bid to escape the abusive conditions at his home, WXYZ reported. Home: A neighbor near the Bothuells' home showed Daily Mail Online the bathroom that Charlie likely used . Tunnel: The bathroom was accessible via this tunnel (right), according to the neighbor, The tunnel's outside door (left) is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men, but crucially, it was left open during the time Charlie was missing so that residents could get rid of a build-up of trash in a dumpster left outside . Discovery: Police officers who dramatically rescued the youngster from the house (pictured) on the eleventh day of a wide-scale search also found a blanket, cereal box and a bowl of chicken bones in the basement . Earlier in the hearing, detective Sgt. Ken Ducker testified about finding Charlie in the roughly 600-square-foot space when he went downstairs looking for evidence that might help the search. 'I was not expecting to find him,' Ducker said. A doctor said the boy was thin with several bruises. Defense attorneys claim Charlie is a liar who left and returned to the house on his own. Bothuell IV insists he didn't know his son was in the basement, which has no door at the top of the stairs. Attorney Shawn Smith asked Ducker if he believed the boy - who is now living with his mother - was in the basement for all 11 days, but a prosecutor objected. The question went unanswered. Judge Shannon Holmes ended the hearing before Charlie was asked about what happened last June. The youngster, who had lived with his father for two years, will return to court on May 6. Reaction: Bothuell IV, who insists he didn't know his son was in the basement, was giving a live TV interview when he was told his son had been found by police.

034d9526d39d1534cfcefe4aca33ef9fa922c712,"A new Kansas law tells poor families that they can't use cash assistance from the state to attend concerts, go swimming, visit theme parks or buy lingerie. The list of don'ts runs to several dozen items. More than 20 other states have such lists. But, the one included by the Republican-dominated Kansas Legislature in a bill that GOP Gov. Sam Brownback planned to sign Thursday appears to be the most exhaustive, according to state Department for Children and Families officials. The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four. To qualify that family must have an annual household income below $31,525 - before taxes - and assets valued at less than $2,000. Cutting back: In this April 13 photo, Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback makes a point during an interview in his office in the Statehouse in Topeka, Kansas . The new restrictions, regarding Kansas applicants, have inspired national criticism and mockery from The Daily Show. Host Jon Stewart suggested that in accepting federal funds, Kansas should be forced to give up items like roads 'paved with luxurious asphalt.' 'The list has attracted attention because it feels mean-spirited,' said Shannon Cotsoradis, president and CEO of the advocacy group Kansas Action for Children. 'It really seems to make a statement about how we feel about the poor.' It is part of a broader welfare law taking effect in July that Brownback and his allies say is aimed at moving poor families from social services into jobs. In Kansas, here’s a list of what would be forbidden to those using cash assisted funds: . 'We want to get people off of public assistance and into private-sector employment, and we've had a lot of success with that,' Brownback during an interview this week with The Associated Press. A 2012 federal law requires states to prevent benefit-card use at liquor stores, gambling establishments or adult-entertainment businesses. At least 23 states have their own restrictions on how cards can be used, mostly for alcohol, tobacco, gambling and adult-oriented businesses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A few states - not Kansas - prohibit buying guns, according to the NCSL, and a few ban tattoos or body piercings. Massachusetts prohibits spending on jewelry, bail bonds, or 'vacation services.' A 2014 Louisiana law bars card use on cruise ships, which is also on the Kansas list. Kansas Department for Children and Families officials said that it's difficult to track how often cash assistance is used for items on the state's new list because recipients can use their benefits cards to obtain cash. The law will limit ATM withdrawals of cash assistance to $25 a day. The department said it reclaimed $199,000 in cash assistance from 81 fraud cases from July through February, but said most involved questions about eligibility. The state provided $14 million in cash assistance during the same period. A 2014 federal report said a check of eight states' data showed transactions with benefit cards at liquor stores, casinos or strip clubs accounted for less than 1 percent of the total. Critics question whether such restrictions can be enforced. Elizabeth Schott, senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said enacting them simply creates an 'aura of abuse.' 'Undermining support for the programs is what the restrictions do,' she said. Phyllis Gilmore, Kansas secretary for children and families, said her state's list is a 'composite' of others and has educational value, sending the message that cash assistance should be used for necessities. 'Every dollar that is used fraudulently is a dollar that is not going to an American who is struggling,' said state Sen. Michael O'Donnell, a Wichita Republican who supported the bill. Helping hand: The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four . Much of the new Kansas law codifies administrative policies enacted after Brownback took office in January 2011, so they'll be harder to undo later. They include a requirement that cash assistance recipients work at least 20 hours a week, be looking for work or enroll in job training. The new law also includes a much-criticized provision shortening the lifetime cap on cash assistance to 36 months from 48 months, although the state Department for Children and Families said recipients rarely bump up against the lower limit. The number of cash assistance recipients in Kansas has dropped 63per cent since Brownback took office, to about 14,700 in February. Brownback said the decline confirms the success of his policies, but critics note that U.S. Census Bureau figures show the state's child poverty rate remaining at about 19per cent through 2013. Brownback said his state's list of prohibited cash-assistance uses has become a way for the left to argue against welfare-to-work policies. 'I think you're seeing the left trying to pillory this,' Brownback said. 'They're just trying to poke fun at it, when it's not what the debate is really about.'","The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four .

Hillary and top aide Huma Abedin wore sunglasses inside the Chipotle on Monday in the Toledo suburb of Maumee and left without being engaged by anyone other than a cashier. Campaign operatives later phoned the New York Times, according to a journalist familiar with the chain of events, so reporters would know she had been there. A Times reporter later persuaded the restaurant's manager to send her photographs of his security-camera footage. Clinton ordered a chicken bowl with guacamole, a chicken salad and a fruit juice. The manager, Charles Wright, told Daily Mail Online that 'it's true nobody recognized her.' 'When the reporters started to call, I went back to the security footage, and there she was,' Wright said. 'The sunglasses probably made her harder to spot.' 'But it's not like there was anything special going on. She just stood in line like everyone else. I hope she stopped at Chipotle locations all the way from New York to wherever she's headed.'

Before visiting Le Claire, Hillary help a roundtable discussion with students at Kirkwood Community College . Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican senator, launched his own presidential campaign earlier this month in Louisville. But Matthew Evans, the second protester, insisted that 'we're not here with anybody.' 'We're here to see the queen.' As Clinton's van pulled into the Kirkwood parking lot - trailed at a short distance by a black Humvee - Evans waved a sign and repeatedly shouted, 'Give the Saudi money back!' Clinton nicknamed her campaign van 'Scooby' in honor of the popular television show Scooby Doo, in which a gang of teenagers drive around a van and solve mysteries . Hillary Clinton's custom van is Chevrolet Express Explorer Limited SE, 'a kind of full-size living room on wheels,' according to Yahoo News. It sports a 6-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission, more than enough horsepower for a Secret Service driver to outrun most any ne-er-do-well. Yahoo reports that the vehicle was produced with all union labor and made in the USA, as any UAW-friendly Democrat would have to ensure. Among other enhancements, Clinton's private ride is armor plated. Armor is usually placed underneath the original exterior of the vehicle. She said in a 2014 speech that it had been nearly two decades since she had driven a car, however, making it likely that she's being chauffeured around the midwest this week. That's a reference to the millions of dollars the Saudi Arabian government donated to the Clinton Foundation while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Republicans cite it as one of many examples of the Clinton family philanthropy pocketing money from countries seeking special dispensation from the State Department during her tenure. The foundation now bears her name, along with those of former president Bill Clinton and their daughter Chelsea. As morning turned to afternoon in Monticello, smoke billowed on the horizon and reporters asked the locals what was burning. The likely culprit, a controlled leaf-burning. But Joe Murphy, who said he was part of the audio crew for Clinton's visit, told Daily Mail Online that 'Hillary might have crashed her Mystery Machine.' 'I should shut up,' he added. On Monday Daily Mail Online spoke with Kirkwood students anticipating Clinton's arrival. One, Corey Jones, said he was chosen to ask her a question, and would focus on illegal immigration. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal,' said Jones. 'She's part of all that. And some people think – well, I think maybe – it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes' from millions of grateful new citizens. While inside the school, according to administrators, Clinton will tour the Advance Manufacturing Lab and see the Auto Technology Lab. Then she is scheduled to sit with a hand-picked group of students and faculty to take questions in a roundtable format. At Casey's General Store in Monticello, cashier Kathy Rigby said she was open to hearing what Hillary has to say . 'I think the whole government sucks. They need to stop running my life. It's everything, including my health care. Especially my health care.' 'But if Hillary comes, I'd go listen to her. I wouldn't vote for anyone I haven't heard from.'

1b5b437eabd1f04ee32236c589c8de9fb1b5748e,"The Good Samaritan who pulled a driver from an SUV hanging dangerously on the edge of a cliff spoke out for the first time on Thursday to describe the rescue that was captured in a heart-stopping photo. Jason Warnock, 29, was driving Wednesday morning in Lewiston, Idaho when he saw debris near the road and looked up to see a vehicle crashed into a chain-link fence on the edge of a cliff. He then parked his car, ran up a pedestrian footbridge and pulled driver Matthew Sitko, 23, out to safety. Warnock chatted with Sitko for a few minutes, but left as soon as police arrived because he had to get back to work. Scroll down for videos . Good Samaritan: Jason Warnock, 29, came forward Thursday and identified himself as the mystery man who rescued a driver in distress Wednesday morning in Lewiston, Idaho . In peril: Warnock was driving Wednesday morning when he noticed debris in the road and looked up to see this car hanging dangerously off the side of a cliff . Quick thinking: He then pulled driver Matthew Sitko, 23, out of the vehicle - saving the young man from a more terrible fate . Mystery: Since he didn't tell police his name, Warnock remained a mystery for 24 hours as the picture of the amazing rescue went viral online . Since he didn't stop to give police his name, Warnock remained a mystery for nearly 24 hours as the photo of the self-less rescue went viral online. Warnock has since come forward to identify himself and speak more about the incident which he wants no credit for. The crash occurred about 8am Wednesday in Lewiston, at a drop called Bryden Canyon, shortly after Sitko had dropped off his younger siblings at school. 'He was listening to a song on the radio, and some lyrics in the song convinced him that it was essentially his time to die. He just closed his eyes, took his hands off the wheel, and pressed the accelerator,'Lewiston interim Police Chief Roger Lanier said. Sitko drove through a yard and over two terraces before getting snared in a chain-link fence. The fence is the only reason the car vehicle did not topple over into the canyon with Sitko still behind the wheel, police told the Lewiston Tribune. It was me: Warnock came forward the next day to identify himself and describe the heart-stopping rescue . Overcome with emotion: Police say Sitko had just dropped off his younger siblings at school when a song came on in the vehicle and it 'convinced him that it was essentially his time to die,' according to police . So close: The chain link fence was the only thing keeping Sitko's SUV from rolling off the side of the cliff . Police previously said the incident was triggered when Sitko had 'some sort of mental or emotional episode' and he only suffered minor injuries. Soon after the crash, Warnock noticed the car and ran to Sitko's aide. 'I knew I had to get him out of the car,' Warnock told NBC, adding that the vehicle was shaking with every movement Sitko made. 'I was going to break the window with one of my tools, but I was worried that the impact might push the car over the ledge,' Warnock said. A disoriented Sitko started talking about his iPod, and that's when Warnock  took action and focused the driver, telling him he was going to pull him out the passenger-side door. 'I was like, ""Give me your hand, you know, because if this thing goes I want to have a hold of you so I can yank you,""' Warnock said. After getting Sitko out of the vehicle safe and sound the two sat down on the nearby grass and talked for a few minutes to calm the driver down. As they were talking, Warnock says Sitko told him that he had started reading the Bible the night before. 'I was like that's awesome, that's great news. I think maybe God put me here at the right time and he held you up here for sure - maybe it's meant to bring you closer to him,' Warnock said. Driver: Mathew Sitko, 23 (pictured) only suffered minor injuries and is recovering . Thankful: He wrote on his Facebook page on Wednesday that he feels 'blessed' for how his ordeal ended . Scene: Sitko crashed while driving along the winding road before crashing through the property and dangling over the edge of the drop. Warnock managed to reach him by climbing the pedestrian bridge, pictured . Warnock says he didn't give his name to police because he didn't need thanks for the act. However, he decided to come forward after the photo went viral. 'I don't want recognition but I know there' no getting away from it until I talk to someone,' Warnock told KHQ. 'We made it. He's alright. And that's all that matters to me,' Warnock added. Not long after the crash Sitko posted to his Facebook page that he felt blessed. 'Good morning everyone! I am truly blessed by God today!! Thank you God & Jesus for taking care of me!! I love you!' he wrote on his Facebook. Sitko lists his job as working for Moscow and Lewiston Landscaping.","Mathew Sitko, 23, crashed his car and ended up hanging over a cliff edge in Lewiston, Idaho in an 'emotional episode' Wednesday morning .

dcc68ce2766c03078026dddf17503f699f099e94,"Javier Hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as Real Madrid kept up their pursuit of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo. Chicharito is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of Lionel Messi who nets once every 81 minutes. The Manchester United loanee put his team in the Champions League semi-finals in midweek with the winner against Atletico Madrid and in Baliados on Sunday night he scored twice to keep Real in the title race. READ PETE JENSON'S FULL MATCH REPORT HERE . Host commentator . Real Madrid are now just two points behind league leaders Barcelona. Chelsea may have wrapped up the title in England but it seems like the La Liga race will go right down to the wire. Real Madrid will have Hernandez to thanks for tonight's win as his two goals were decisive in their win over Celta. The home side the better side for large stages throughout the game but Real's quality in the final third made the difference. Yet another sign of respect by Ancelotti towards Celta. The Italian tactician now has six defenders on the pitch following the arrival of Arbeloa. Real Madrid now have three at the back with Carvajal and Marcelo acting as wing backs. Ancelotti's tactical switch shows just how much of a threat Celta have been during the 80-odd minutes or so. Hernandez will not get the chance of scoring a hat-trick as Ancelotti has decided to take the Mexican off. Pepe has been brought on to shore up the back-line. It's that man Hernandez again. Sergio Ramos runs up the pitch before playing a delightful through pass to Hernandez with the outside of his foot. The Mexican then takes one touch to bring the ball down before placing the ball into the net. A fine goal by the Real Madrid loanee. Some great football being played by Celta - and remember their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m Real pay Ronaldo. But they are inevitably leaving themselves wide open on the counter. An equaliser doesn't look far off as Real fail to get to grips with Celta. The away side continue to counter attack with Hernandez going close after a neat run from the halfway line. Real Madrid are playing with fire. The home side should have been given a penalty as Kroos has just swiped the legs of Orellana, who was racing towards goal. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti may have to freshen his side up during the next 10 minutes or so. They are still look far from convincing. Here's a reminder of who the Italian tactician can call on from the bench. Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Ronaldo has always scored against Celta Vigo whenever he has faced the La Liga outfit while wearing a Real Madrid shirt. He will be desperate to add to his outstanding tally of 39 league goals. No Bale and Benzema, no problem - Chicharito and James Rodriguez very good in the first half. Celta still in it but to play that well in the first 45 minutes and to go in at half time losing, it will be hard to lift themselves again. Real Madrid are extremely fortunate to be winning this game. Celta have looked assured and have really troubled their opponent's back-line. Nolito opened the scoring before Real took the lead thanks to goals by Toni Kroos and Javier Hernandez. Celta looked to be heading into the interval on level terms after Santi Mina's goal, however James Rodriguez struck before the break to make it 3-2 to Real. Real Madrid's luck appears to be in tonight as James Rodriguez has just scored an extremely fortunate goal. His shot is heading towards the arms of Sergio, in the Celta goal, until his shot deflects into the opposite corner and lands in the back of the net. Real do not deserve to be winning this game. Ronaldo almost puts his side back in the lead. The Portuguese forward races past Celta's defence before unleashing a low shot which looks destined to be heading for the back of the net. However his left-footed drives smashes against the post and rebounds to a Celta player. Remains 2-2. Barcelona will be delighted with the scoreline and Celta Vigo's performance during the opening 40 minutes of tonight's game. The home side continue to look the better side but they must be wary of Real's threat on the counter-attack. Real appear to be struggling in the absence of two members of the famous 'BBC' trio. They seem to be missing the pace of both Bale and Benzema in the final third. Not just because he's just scored, and not just because he scored four in one game two weeks ago, but 19-year-old Santi Mina is going to be one hell of a player. What is going on here? Just as we think Real are starting to find second gear - Celta go and grab an equaliser. This time it is Santi Mina who beats Casillas. He smashes the ball against the woodwork before tapping in the rebound from close range. One man who does seem to have taken confidence from the win over Atletico id Hernandez. He may have had to make do with a place on the bench during the majority of the season but he is now showing his worth. Hernandez shows a burst of pace before finishing past Sergio. I expected Real to come into this match with an extra bounce in their step following their win over Atletico but it has been the complete opposite. They look rattled and have really struggled during the opening 20 minutes of tonight's match. Second big assist in a week from Ronaldo. He's after his 40th league goal tonight. Celta have scored 38 as a team - that's what they are up against. It didn't take long for Real to get back on level terms. Ronaldo goes on a dangerous run down the right but fails to pick out a Real Madrid team-mate. The ball eventually falls to Kroos, who has the easy task of side-footing the ball into the net. Game on. Celta Vigo, who have started the brighter of the two sides, score by hitting Real on the counter attack. Nolito bursts down the left before cutting in between two defenders and shooting low past Iker Casillas. Fully deserved lead for the home side. Bright enough start from Celta. Ancelotti has not won here in any of his previous three visits with three different teams - Juventus, Milan and Madrid last season. Celta have started the match brightly with Real having to sit back and deal with their opponent's attacking threat. It looks like they will not be afraid of the European champions which should make for a good spectacle. Evidence shows that Real Madrid have a better win percentage without their Welsh wizard. Read Ben Nagle's piece on Bale's impact HERE. Manchester United's Javier Hernandez will lead the line for Real Madrid due to the absence of Karim Benzema. The Mexican international will be high in confidence following his late winner in the Champions League against rivals Atletico. Real Madrid XI: Casillas, Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Illarramendi, Isco, Rodriguez, Hernandez, Ronaldo . Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese .

Attention switches from the Barclays Premier League to the La Liga title race as Real Madrid face Celta Vigo at Balaidos in tonight's evening kick-off.

Carlo Ancelotti will have to make do without the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric for Sunday evening's encounter at Balaidos, however the Italian tactician will be able to call on the services of a rejuvenated Javier Hernandez.","Nolito scores opener after just nine minutes to put his side in unlikely lead .

18ada494caf05fe73c56a85f8134ad6ee9e7a27c,"A Florida university is investigating the death of a student who drowned in Daytona Beach to determine whether or not hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, was reported missing after going swimming with student s at 3am on Sunday and students who were with him said strong currents pulled Parks out to sea. His body was found Monday morning. Students who were with Parks, who were all part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year, said no hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, drowned in Daytona Beach on Sunday after going for a swim with friends at 3am. He was pulled out to see by a strong current and his body was later found on Monday morning . But Bethune-Cookman University is investigating Parks death after university administration 'heard rumors' that hazing was involved. Parks and the men he was swimming with were part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year . A Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Keisha Boyd said that the university administration had 'heard rumors' about hazing and that Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is investigating the student's death, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Parks' mother, Carolyn Parks, said she didn't know why her son would decide to swim in the ocean. 'I don't know why it happened, why he would go into the water like this, because he is not a good swimmer,' she told WESH 2. 'And I had talked to him just before he came out here and he told me he was tired and was going to rest, not knowing he was going to come out here to the beach.' Damian Parks is the second son Carolyn Parks has had to mourn in recent months. Her 16-year-old son died in Miami six months ago. Parks was with four other men in about 5ft of water near Sun Splash Park when he lost grip of a friend's clothing and a the current pulled him out to sea, according to a U.S. Coast Guard report. Parks' friends said that there was 'no foul play at all' and that is was not hazing. They added that the group was 'having fun' and that Parks had not been drinking before the incident . Uamil Turner, who was at the beach, said 'it wasn't hazing', and he was unsure where the rumor came from. Marquise Nelson, who was also at the beach with Parks, said that there 'was no foul play at all'. 'Damian didn't do anything he didn't want to do, and everyone knew that,' Nelson told the News-Journal. 'Everyone was having fun.' Parks friends said that the student had not been drinking the night he drowned nor was he impaired in any way. Deputy Chief Ray Manchester of Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue said there's no sign of hazing in the incident and that the men had, however, been out bar-hopping before going for a swim. He added that he believed 'they may have been drinking' and that the ocean was rough when the men entered the water. Students and staff at Bethune-Cookman University mourned Parks' death during a prayer vigil held on Monday after the student's body was found . The university said that though the investigation is ongoing, it still wants to celebrate Parks' life and support his family 'in this most difficult time' The university is investigating into hazing, while Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is assisting with toxicology and witness statements, Manchester said. Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Boyd said that though the investigation was ongoing, the university is still celebrating Parks' life. 'Once any additional information is provided by the Beach Patrol, the University will issue another statement. While information regarding the events of April 20th are continuing to surface, we ask that the public join B-CU in supporting the Parks family in this most difficult time,' she said. The university held a prayer vigil on Monday, in which University President Edison Jackson planted a tree in Parks' memory. Students at the vigil said that Parks 'never stopped laughing' and was both talented and artistic. During Monday's vigil, University President Edison planted a tree in Parks' memory.

7ba5e9b47ec9067215c4830dd186f1ae0129bdd5,"A second suspect has been charged in the stabbing death of a married lawyer at an upscale Washington D.C. hotel. Jamyra Gallmon of Washington was arrested last week and charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 at the boutique Donovan Hotel. According to a police affidavit filed in court on Thursday, she stole just $40 and the victim's Metro SmarTrip card. Her roommate - and alleged girlfriend - 19-year-old Dominique Johnson was arrested on Wednesday and is accused of being an accomplice. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, right, has been charged in the stabbing death of a lawyer at an upscale Washington hotel stole just $40 and the victim's Metro SmarTrip card, while Dominique Johnson, left, has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery . She has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery and made an initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday during which she denied the charge against her. According to court documents, Johnson was charged because she knew Gallmon was going to rob Messerschmitt. She also allegedly accompanied Gallmon to CVS to buy the zip ties used to tie the victim up. According to documents, after Gallmon returned from the hotel, she told Johnson that the robbery 'went badly.' When Johnson was arrested on Wednesday, she had two Metro cards, including Messerschmitt's card which had been used on April 1. Gallmon has a court hearing scheduled for Friday, but that has now been rescheduled until May 8. She is being held without bond. The woman has admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale hotel with the intention of robbing him. Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing, told detectives that the robbery went wrong when Messerschmitt grabbed her arm, causing a flashback to a time when she had been assaulted. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . Gallmon was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9 . His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Her attorney asserted in court that it was a case of 'imperfect self-defense.' Court documents concerning a rent dispute confirm Gallmon and Johnson as roomates. About two weeks after Messerschmitt was killed, the two were ordered by a D.C. Superior Court judge to pay $1,860 in rent owed since January. A neighbor of the two women said he was surprised that they could be mixed up in such a crime. 'They were great neighbors. They never made much noise, nothing out of the ordinary. Great people,' Tony Johnson told WUSA9. He said he believed they were also lovers. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . Among the items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. On the left, another view of the security footage of Jamyra Gallmon at the Washington hotel and on the right, Messerschmitt . Emotional: Last month, Messerschmitt's wife, Kim Vuong, held a press conference, asking for help in locating her husband's killer . Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. Authorities have said they are searching for anyone else who may have e-mailed the account used by Gallmon — chrissanchez0906@yahoo.com — but have not said whether anyone has come forward. The new court documents do not say whether anyone else beside Messerschmitt was targeted. Last month, Messerchmitt's wife Kim Vuong gave an emotional speech, asking for help in finding her husband's killer. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. A Cincinnati native, Messerchmitt attended Ohio State University where he met his wife. He went on to study law at Boston University before working at a firm in Chicago. He then worked at two more firms in the D.C. area before transferring to DLA Piper last year, as a specialist in intellectual property law.","Dominique Johnson, 19, was arrested on Wednesday and has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery .

Among them, the family of eight-year-old Martin Richard, the youngest victim to lose his life in the April 15, 2013 attack, headed to Boylston Street to help officials unveil commemorative banners. Four orange signs each bearing a white heart and the word 'Boston' were placed at the site. They were mounted on poles wrapped in blue and yellow flowers, the marathon's colors, to mark the tragedy that took three lives and left more than 260 others injured. Martin's older brother Henry and younger sister Jane, who lost a leg in the explosion, helped unwrap one of the flags on the street as bagpipes played during the low-key ceremony. Scroll down for video . Somber: The Martin family, whose son Richard was killed in the Boston bombings, walk down Boylston Street with Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, left, ahead of a ceremony to mark two years since the tragedy .

Ceremony: Jane and Henry Martin remove a drape covering a memorial banner to honor the victims. In total, four large orange banners were unveiled near the explosion sites on Tuesday morning . Memories: The family takes a moment to reflect at the scene as a ceremony to mark the anniversary begins . The family of Krystle Campbell, who also died in the attacks, helped unwrap another banner with the help of Governor Charlie Baker. Also at the ceremony was Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the bombings. His ashen face was captured in a now-iconic photograph as he was wheeled away by strangers. One of those strangers, Carlos Arredondo, is now a close friend. Arredondo, who became known as 'the man in the cowboy hat' was also at the site on Tuesday morning to greet Bauman as he walked on prosthetic limbs. 'We're here to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives,' Bauman told WFXT-TV. They were joined by city officials including Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker. At 2.49pm, a moment of silence was held to mark the moment the first of two bombs exploded near the finish line two years ago, while church bells sounded throughout the city. Well-wishers visited the site of the explosions throughout Tuesday to pay tribute to the young people who had lost their lives, and stopped to pay their respects at a memorial bearing their names. Mayor Walsh has declared April 15 'One Boston Day,' on which Bostonians are encouraged to perform random acts of kindness and generosity. Always remembered: Jane Martin sits on a new bench with the words 'Keep Running Boston' and 'Boston Strong' written across it outside the fire station on Boylston Street . Fitting right in: Jane tries on a firefighter's helmet during a visit to the Boylston Street fire station . Proud: She grins alongside her mother Denise, father Bill and big brother Henry inside the fire station . Thankful: Denise Richard, who was hit in the head by shrapnel in the bombings, looks at banners signed by members of the public after the attack and now hanging at a fire station on Boylston Street . 'April 15 is a date that has come to stand for our city's deepest values,' he said as he announced the new tradition. 'In many respects, those most affected by the events of two years ago have shown us all the way back - with their courage, grace and determination,' Governor Baker said in a statement released after the ceremony. 'They honor the past, remember and treasure loved ones lost and injured, and look forward to a better future. We should strive to do the same.' Another victim who lost a leg in the bombings, Rebekah Gregory, took to Facebook on Tuesday morning to describe her disbelief that two years had already passed. She was at the marathon with her young son, Noah, and was less than 10 feet from where the first bomb exploded. She needed 17 surgeries and eventually had her left leg amputated last year. Last month, she testified against the surviving bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, in his trial. Strong: Jeff Bauman, who lost both of his legs in the bombings, is pictured with his wife Erin and their daughter, Nora Gail, as they walk down Boylston Street in Boston this morning . Incredible: He was accompanied by Carlos Arredondo, who helped save his life two years ago . Close friends: The two men have built a close friendship since the day of the blast . Side by side: Arredondo, whose adult sons both died in the years before the marathons, helped save Bauman's life after he was hit by the bombs. They two men are seen speaking with reporters on Tuesday . Tribute: A man touches a memorial to the victims, from left, MIT police officer Sean Collier, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, 23-year-old Lingzi Lu and eight-year-old Martin Richard, who were killed by the two bombers . Memorial: The new banners show white hearts with the word 'Boston' inside. They have been placed at the top of lampposts, which have been decorated by flowers in blue and yellow - the marathon's colors . 'It is extremely emotional to look back on the last two years of my life,' she wrote. 'To remember what it felt like to be bleeding out on the pavement, wondering if I would ever see my child's smile again... 'It's been a long road. Some days, I'm not quite sure how I have made it out of the bed. And if I'm being really honest, a few times I haven't. 'But no matter what, there is one thing that I always keep in mind. I am BLESSED. And no matter how hard someone tries, they will never be able to take that away from me.' She plans to run the last three miles of the marathon next Monday. She also visited the site last year, but was pushed in a wheelchair as she struggled with issues with her leg. 'This time I won't be laying on the ground in pieces, or having to be assisted because I can't do things on my own,' she wrote. Support: A man wearing a shirt reading 'Boston Strong' and 'Survivor' walks near the ceremony on Tuesday . Respects: A passerby wearing a t-shirt honoring Martin pauses near one of the two explosion sites . Reflection: People stop by the memorial at the scene of the first explosion on the marathon route . Heartbreaking: A group of women gather near the site during the moment of silence on Tuesday afternoon . Powerful: A bunch of yellow and blue flowers lay at the scene of the first blast in Boston on Tuesday . 'This time...the only thing hitting the ground will be my running shoe, as I show myself and the rest of the world that I am back, stronger than ever....and there is NO stopping me now.' Three people were killed and more than 260 others were wounded in the April 15, 2013 attacks and the two bombers were cornered days later, after they shot dead an MIT police officer. One of the bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during a shootout with police in Watertown. The surviving bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was last week convicted of 30 counts during his federal trial. The jury is now deciding whether he should receive the death penalty but they have taken a break until next Tuesday. This year's marathon will be held next Monday.

d26f5c32d728160c2956929fda6e601742280f9d,"Prince Harry is headed for his final tour of duty in the elite SAS headquarters in Perth, Western Australia where the soldier who claims to have shot the Taliban warlord who was intent on killing the royal heir works as a training commander. Mark Donaldson is one of Australia's most highly decorated soldiers, one of the very few to have been awarded the nation's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, for his bravery in Afghanistan. Corporal Donaldson VC revealed in 2013 how four years earlier he had been a member of an elite Special Air Services unit ordered to assassinate a Taliban warlord who had boasted that he intended to kill Prince Harry. To kill a prince: Captain Harry Wales (pictured on his first tour of duty to Afghanistan) was the target of a Taliban warlord codenamed Javelin who had boasted he would kill the royal heir but was shot dead by a crackunit from the Australian SAS, where Harry is headed next for the final chapter of his military career . Hunted down: Corporal Mark Donaldson VC, one of Australia's most highly decorated soldiers is pictured in Afghanistan where he and fellow SAS troops hunted down and shot dead the Taliban warlord who had boasted of killing Prince Harry . Valour under fire: Mark Donaldson (pictured, right, with fellow troopers in Afghanistan) was awarded the VC for his actions in September 2008, when, despite being advised not to go and help, Donaldson ran 80 metres to rescue a wounded interpreter, while under heavy machine gun fire for a large group of insurgents . Giants among men: A rare gathering of three living recipients of Australia's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, from left, Corporal Mark Donaldson, Keith Payne who won the VC in Vietnam, and (right) Ben Roberts-Smith who also earned his honour while fighting in Afghanistan . Known in the British military as Captain Harry Wales, the fourth in line to the throne will fulfill one of his dreams by embedding with the Australian SAS. The first threat to his life by the Taliban came between December, 2007 and February, 2008 when as a 23-year-old he spent ten weeks  on his first tour of duty to Afghanistan in the southern province of Helmand guiding fighter jets towards suspected Taliban targets. In his book The Crossroad, Corporal Donaldson revealed how the SAS regiment had uncovered a Taliban fighter codenamed Javelin in Afghanistan in 2008. Targeted by the Taliban: A Taliban warlord codenamed Javelin targeted Prince Harry on his first tour of Afghanistan and in 2012 warlords again threatened to 'eliminate' the prince . 'Javelin had been saying he was going to take out Prince Harry,' he wrote. 'We flew by Chinook to a place called Paygolkar to go after two targets codenamed Longbow and Javelin. They were supposed to be important Taliban commanders.' On the first night time attempt by Donaldson and his fellow Australian commandos, they entered the compound where the Javelin was based, in Uruzgan province,a Taliban stronghold in central Afghanistan, but the commander got away. Almost a year later in 'an exact same type of job, at the exact time of night', Donaldson writes in The Crossroad, they shot him dead. 'We went into Paygolkar one night, searching for codename Longbow. We went onto the roof of the same compound we'd been in the previous year and found nine rocket-propelled grenade warheads and a landmine. 'We didn't get Longbow, but three Talibs squirted from the target building just before we were able to take it down. They ran straight into our cordon teams and were killed. ""One had a very nice chrome-plated, clean AK-47. He turned out to be Javelin, the target we'd gone after a year earlier in the same area. Further evidence established that he had a job helping high-value individuals coming in from Pakistan.' Prince Harry's first tour in Afghanistan was cut short after an imposed media blackout on his presence there was breached. He returned for a second tour  in 2012, when again the Taliban voiced a threat to 'eliminate him'. Corporal Mark Donaldson was to have further brushes with Afghan fighters, being shot in the leg in 2012. In his memoir, he revealed more details of the incident in which his bravery had earned him the Victoria Cross. On September 2, 2008, just  weeks after his first attempt to kill the Taliban warlord Javelin, the SAS trooper and twelve other Australians in a military convoy were ambushed by a large group of insurgents. One of the interpreters had been shot and was lying on the ground. Despite being advised not to go and help, Donaldson ran 80 metres to rescue the wounded man, while under heavy machine gun fire. In 2013 the prince visited SAS HQ in Perth to pay tribute to special forces troops killed in the line of duty, and is said to have met Donaldson. Next week, he will get his first chance to join the elite group and perhaps be trained in house-to-house combat using live rounds by the highly decorated soldier who killed the warlord who threatened the prince's life. Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday to kick-off his final, four week long tour of duty. The royal's last tour before hanging up his fatigues and retiring from the armed services will also see him serve alongside Australian soldiers  in Darwin and Sydney. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday ahead of his four-week stint with the Australian Defence Force, which will be his last tour of duty in the military . The prince will spend time with Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers in the Northern Territory, and the Australian Army's Sydney-based 6th Aviation Regiment. If he passes military testing, it is possible he'll fly helicopters while with the Sydney regiment. The prince will join diggers on urban training exercises and bush patrols as well as pack marches and physical training. Before the military stretch gets underway, Prince Harry will travel to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, according to an Australian Defence Force statement. A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchange for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule. Captain Harry Wales, as he is known in the British Army, will fall in with elite soldiers at the Perth SAS base and take on training exercises in the bush with the indigenous unit NORFORCE operating out of Darwin . He will also be allowed to spend time off-base, meaning Harry will have plenty of time for handshakes with his fans, but he is also said to be looking forward to training with the elite Australian SAS . 'Prince Harry is tremendously looking forward to starting his four week attachment with the ADF,' the spokesman said, according to the ABC. 'It has been an opportunity he has been keen to explore for a couple of years now and is delighted to be able to do it before completing his military service with the British Armed Forces later this year.' The fourth-in-line to the throne royal will have his army activities briefly interrupted at the end of the month, when he flies to Gallipoli with Prince Charles for Anzac Day commemorations. The ADF confirmed Harry will be given down time off-base during his stint, meaning some lucky punters could have a pint with the prince. A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchange for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule . Harry will spend time with the elite SAS and Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers during his military exchange . However, the ADF said it has created a very real experience for Prince Harry. 'Defence’s focus for this attachment is to provide Captain Wales with an authentic military experience in the Australian Army that builds on his previous experience with coalition forces and complements his work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' a statement read. 'Defence has selected units that best utilise Captain Wales’ skills and allow him to experience a broad range of Army capabilities. The attachment will also allow Captain Wales to share the experience and knowledge he has gained over 10 years of military service in the British Armed Forces, including two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan.'","Prince Harry arrives in Australia next Monday ahead of four-week stay .

1a89ad0520324da365991ae7124dfc043859d142,"Octavia Spencer shocked and angered hundreds of fans at a recent book signing,  acting like an 'ungrateful b****,' say eyewitnesses who were so incensed with the actress's behavior they stormed out and demanded refunds. The 44-year-old Academy Award winner, who won Best Supporting Actress for her role as Minnie Jackson, a maid, in 'The Help,' and is currently starring in the film 'Insurgent,' was at Barnes & Noble bookstore at The Grove in Los Angeles last week to autograph copies of her children's book 'Randi Rhodes Ninja Detective — The Sweetest Heist in History.' But before the night was over people were dragging their kids out of line, demanding refunds on the books and stormed out of the store in disgust. 'Octavia was mean, rude and horrible to everyone,' former Octavia fan, Angel Guzman explained to the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview. Scroll down for video . Behind the smile: Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer was at the Barnes & Noble bookstore at The Grove in Los Angeles last week to autograph copies of her children's book 'Randi Rhodes Ninja Detective — The Sweetest Heist in History.' But there was nothing sweet about Spencer, who complained constantly, refused to engage with fans or pose with them for a photo . Before the night was over people were dragging their kids out of line, demanding refunds on the books and stormed out of the store in disgust . 'Initially, there was a Q & A but Octavia acted like she was forced to be there and she took her anger out on all of us, including the kids. 'Octavia's answers were short and blunt and there were times she rolled her eyes to the back of her head like she couldn't believe someone could ask such a stupid question. It quickly became a very uncomfortable situation for all of us,' says Guzman. 'It was clear they just needed to proceed to the autographs because Octavia was not responding well at all to the questions.' Octavia was scheduled to autograph her books from 7-9 p.m. but she was complaining the moment she arrived about the space they put her in, the 'tiny glass of water' she was given, that her feet were hurting so she took a long bathroom break, leaving everyone to wonder if she left or not. 'Octavia was acting like a diva. She was mad because the event coordinator gave her a small glass of water but she wanted a large liter of 'good water' and demanded to know why she was being treated this way,' Guzman continued. 'All of this happened in front of everyone who has been standing there for at least an hour, with their restless kids, waiting for her to show up. Octavia didn't acknowledge the crowd in any way; she just showed up and started to complain. 'But when the she finally started to sign the books is when things went from bad to worse.' Ordinarily, celebrities allow their fans to take a picture with them at these book signings, but Octavia said no touching, no coming around the table to take a pic with her and she also refused to have small talk with anyone — just give her the book to sign and keep it moving. Talent: Spencer won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance in The Help . And she didn't even want to ask the customer what was their name, they had to tell the assistant standing nearby their name, she wrote it on a sticky pad and handed it to Octavia, who then signed the book and slid it over to the edge of the table for pickup, like it was a fast food window. After watching Octavia being abrupt and rude to several people one woman grabbed her 8-year-old and stormed off yelling, 'This woman is an ungrateful, nasty b****! I'm getting a refund on this stupid book. If she talked to me or my child like that it would get really ugly in here so it's best we get our money back and go home before something jumps off.' 'I'm probably the most militant person you'll ever meet and I speak my mind without provocation sometimes,' Octavia was once quoted, and she admits she is a nasty sleepwalker. But clearly, according the eyewitnesses at this book signing, she doesn't have to be asleep to be nasty. 'After several more encounters with her audience, a man approached with an 8X10 photo of Octavia for her to sign but she was clearly furious and said, 'I'm NOT doing that. 'The guy was devastated, saying he bought it specifically for that day, that he was a big fan and he promised he would not post it on any social media outlets but she didn't care — she said 'absolutely, not.' But she did sign the book he just bought and slid it across the table to the guy — who was absolutely dumbfounded,' Guzman explained. 'And boy, that was it. The crowd started to leave in droves and went directly to the counter to get refunds for the books.' Attitude: 'When someone approached the table, Octavia demanded to see the receipt to prove they purchased the book before she would sign an autograph, ' says a former fan about the event. ' It was outrageous' Another eyewitness told the Daily Mail they agreed that Octavia was horrible and didn't care that she was being a **** in front of children. 'I just left, who does she think she is anyway — Elizabeth Taylor?' the eyewitness exclaimed. 'I could not believe how rude she was to all of those people who were there to support her. 'When someone approached the table, Octavia demanded to see the receipt to prove they purchased the book before she would sign an autograph. It was outrageous — and insulting. A call by Daily Mail Online to Spencer's representative for comment was not returned.","Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer was at the Barnes & Noble bookstore at The Grove in Los Angeles to autograph copies of her new children's book .

a60dc1d59fa2706939a3b4c42a1564ef9880bf4d,"A popular Twin Cities radio host has revealed her year of terror after she was stalked by a stranger who bombarded her with emails, calls and presents, including bottles of wine and sausages. Maria Lucia detailed her year-long battle in a letter to fans on The Current's website on Wednesday as she explained she would be taking some time off from the station following the ordeal. The alleged stalker, Patrick Henry Kelly, from Eden Prairie, has been charged in the case and is set to go on trial next week. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. 'This has been a tough year for me,' Lucia, 44, wrote in the online letter. Terrified: Patrick Henry Kelly, left, allegedly repeatedly violated a restraining order radio host Mary Lucia, right, had taken out against him after he sent her letters, emails and gifts to her home and workplace . 'My life over the last year has involved a series of restraining orders, seemingly endless calls to 911, the installation of security cameras at home, and police photo ID line-ups. 'I've been constantly looking over my shoulder, dead-bolting doors, and jumping when someone rings my doorbell or my motion lights go off.' It began when Kelly, 56, wrote Lucia a letter about his dead dog and she responded sympathetically in March 2014, the Star-Tribune reported. He then started sending her 'delusional' e-mails and calling her on her personal numbers. He also sent her gifts, including flowers, sausages, candy and a picture of a man in a mask, to both her home and her workplace, according to court records. In July, she filed for a restraining order against him. 'He believes we are in a relationship,' she told the court. 'He got ahold of my cellphone # somehow and left me a message about getting together this weekend. He's unstable and delusional.' Fears: Lucia posted this letter detailing her terrifying ordeal to The Current's website on Wednesday as she explained to fans why she would be taking some time off work for a while . She was granted the restraining order, which prevented him from being within two city blocks of her Minneapolis home, but he allegedly went on to violate it on multiple occasions. 'I wake up thinking of you and repeat before bed,' he allegedly wrote in one handwritten note he sent Lucia. 'This feeling is so real to me! Just can't ignore it anymore.' He left candles, a bottle of wine, a frog calculator and flowers at her home - allegedly violating the restraining order five times between August and October 2014. 'Do you know what it's like to feel unsafe watching a band at First Avenue?' Lucia wrote online on Wednesday. 'To worry any time a stranger approaches you? To not be able to sleep or eat properly? That's what my past year has been like. 'I've made a 21-year career on the radio in this town being honest and authentic, and now I'm deathly afraid to reveal too much of myself on the air.' Scary: Lucia, pictured, said she was always looking over her shoulder or fearful when a stranger approached her because of how Kelly allegedly bombarded her with letters and emails saying they should be together . After the incessant contact, station officials alerted the St. Paul police department, which launched an investigation before turning it over to Minneapolis authorities. Kelly was charged last October with a single count of stalking for violating the court order. He could go to prison for up to 10 years as well as a $20,000 fine if he is found guilty at his trial, which starts on Tuesday. Lucia did not say how much time she will be taking off but said she plans to return 'soon'.

The Par-3 Contest has become a much-loved part of the Masters build-up, and is played on Augusta National’s nine-hole par-3 course on the Wednesday before the tournament. American 36-year-old Kevin Streelman won the Par-3 contest after a three-hole play-off with Camilo Villegas. The pair both shot five under par, but the Colombian Villegas hit his tee shot on the eighth hole into the water during the play-off. McIlroy is desperate to win at Augusta this week and add the Masters, which is the only major he is yet to win, to his trophy collection and will get down to the serious business on Thursday. Victory at the Augusta National will mean a third major title in a row for the Northern Irishman, who shot a one-under-par round in the Par-3 Contest after winning The Open and the USPGA Championship at the back end of 2014. Woods, meanwhile, had declined to participate in the mini-tournament, which he has previously called 'distracting',since 2004. But Woods gave his fans a treat by joining in with the event for the first time in 11 years, with his daughter, Sam, 7, and his son, Charlie, 6, keeping him company. His playing partners were old pals Steve Stricker and Fred Couples. Sam Snead won the first Par 3 Contest in 1960, two years after the course was completed. A record five holes-in-one were made in the 2002 event, when Japan's Toshi Izawa made back-to-back aces on holes five and six. Players often invite their wives or children to caddie for them. Reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson, who was also a winner at Augusta in 2012, was joined by his wife Angie and son Caleb for the Par-3 Contest. Watson played with his American compatriot Rickie Fowler, who had girlfriend Alexis Randock as his caddy. But this is the competition nobody wants to win. Nobody has ever won the Wednesday warm-up and the Masters in the same week, leading many to remark on the 'curse' of the Par-3 Contest. Those who have recently discovered to their fate that these twin feats are seemingly unachievable include Padriag Harrington, winner of the Par 3 Contest in 2003 and 2004, former Open champion Louis Oosthuizen (2010) and former world No 1 Luke Donald, who claimed the prize in 2011 but remains majorless.

'I want you to know that I am very sorry,' Stroud said during the somber meeting, which was filmed by Nightline. 'It's a stain on me that will be with me until I go to my grave.' 'Right,' Ford responded, without looking up. 'But it still cost me 31 years of my life and then nothing at the end but death because they give me from six to eight months to live.' Scroll down for videos . Apology: Marty Stroud, left, visited Glenn Ford, right, at his home to apologize for putting him behind bars for 30 years for a murder he didn't commit. Ford was released from prison in Angola last year . Face-to-face: The 65-year-old, who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer shortly after being freed from prison, shook the former prosecutor's hand as he walked into his home . 'I'm sorry,' Ford added. 'I can't forgive you.' Stroud, who wished Ford the best before leaving the home, had asked to meet the man after apologizing to him in a powerful letter published in The Shreveport Times last month. In the letter, Stroud admitted that he was to blame for mistakenly putting Ford behind bars for the fatal shooting of a jeweler, despite no murder weapon or witnesses placing him at the scene. 'In 1984, I was 33 years old,' he wrote. 'I was arrogant, judgmental, narcissistic and very full of myself. I was not as interested in justice as I was in winning.' Stroud, 63, wrote the letter after the state ruled that Ford was not entitled to receive $330,000 in compensation for his time spent behind bars because he could not prove he did not know about the killing before it was carried out. 'Glenn Ford should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life,' Stroud wrote. Struggle: Ford told Stroud that he could not forgive him for what he had done as a young lawyer . Pain: After Stroud left, Ford was overcome with emotion and was comforted by his carers, pictured . 'The audacity of the state's effort to deny Mr. Ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of Louisiana justice is appalling.' Ford was accused of shooting Isadore Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Mr Ford had done occasional yard work, in 1983 and was convicted the following year. He was sent to prison, where he lived with little light or heat, while Stroud, who had been with the Caddo District Attorney's office for two years, went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team. 'That's sick,' he said in his letter. 'I had been entrusted with the duty to seek the death of a fellow human being, a very solemn task that certainly did not warrant any ""celebration"".' From behind bars, Ford continued to protest his innocence. Then in 2013, State District Judge Ramona Emanuel voided the conviction and sentence based on an informant claiming that another man, Jake Robinson, had confessed to killing Rozeman. Regrets: A.M. 'Marty' Stroud III, pictured, wrote a lengthy apology letter to Ford last month that was published in a local newspaper. In the letter, he also slammed the state for refusing to pay the man compensation . Robinson, along with his brother Henry, had been eyed by investigators in relation to the killing but have never been charged in Rozeman's death. They have since been indicted in other murders. Wrongly accused: Ford, a father-of-four (pictured in a booking photo), was sent to death row in 1984 . 'My fault was that I was too passive,' Stroud said in his letter last month. 'Had I been more inquisitive, perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago... 'I did not hide evidence, I simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion. And that omission is on me.' He added that the odds were stacked against Ford, whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law. Ford, who is black, also faced an all-white jury. 'I apologize to Glenn Ford for all the misery I have caused him and his family,' Stroud wrote. 'I apologize to the family of Mr. Rozeman for giving them the false hope of some closure.' Ford walked free from Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola on March 11, 2014, wearing a jean jacket, sweater and beanie hat and carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes. As he walked out of the prison gates, he said he was sad he had not been around to raise his now-adult sons, but added: 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.' Prison officials gave the then-64-year-old a debit card worth just $20. That, along with the money that he had in his bank account, left Mr Ford with a paltry $20.24 to his name. Freed: Ford is pictured in March 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars. He was given just $20 but was taken in by a non-profit group who found a free place for him to stay . Making the days count: Ford, pictured earlier this year, relies on Social Security disability and food stamps. He is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer, which is now terminal . His lawyers set up an Amazon wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so Ford could start to re-build his life, and he continues to accept donations. With the help of a non-profit group, Resurrection After Exoneration, he had a place to live free of charge and has since moved to his own apartment. He relies on Social Security disability and food stamps, while volunteers help to take care of him. He has also visited California to see his four sons. After he left prison, he learned he had Stage 3 lung cancer, which has now progressed to Stage 4. Ahead of the meeting with Stroud, he told Nightline he was shocked by Stroud's letter, but that he refused to get angry over his situation. 'I'm upset, yes, but it's not my driving force,' he said, too weak to even open his eyes. '[My driving force] is to get well as I possibly can. I can't do that being mad at Marty Stroud.'

8f324e3064f6cdc9c378dfcf4545ed2c124e7103,"When Lane Smith passed away in a freak accident last July, he left behind his heavily-pregnant girlfriend and their unborn son. But now, nearly eight months after his passing, the young Oklahoma family has been reunited in their first ever family portrait, thanks to some clever photoshopping by a local photographer. Kayli Henley was snapping pictures of six-month-old Taos and his 20-year-old mother, Sierra Sharry, when the young mom asked the photographer if she could make their family complete. So Henley took a photograph of Smith from the family and, with a ghostly filter, fitted the image around his girlfriend and son, as if he were standing over them. Scroll down for video . Family portrait: A photoshopped image shows Sierra Sharry holding her six-month-old son Taos with her boyfriend, the baby's father, Lane Smith, standing behind them. Smith passed away before his son's birth . Sharry called the ghostly final picture 'amazing'. 'Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what,' she told KOCO. After sharing the image to her Facebook page, the photographer found that other people thought the image was amazing too. It has been liked more than 200,000 times and shared more than 25,000 times, and Henley has been inundated with requests to create other pictures for families who have lost a loved one. In a post shared on the Facebook page, Sharry explained that in July 2014, she and 26-year-old Smith had been nervous about the impending birth of their son. 'We were scared as any new parents would be but ready for the adventure together,' she said. Excitement: 26-year-old Lane Smith, pictured with his girlfriend in the couple's pregnancy announcement, died after hitting his head in an accident in July 2014. His son was born just a few weeks later . When she was around eight months pregnant, they went to jet boat races in El Reno, she recalled. But the weather was too warm for Sharry, so she left her boyfriend there with his family. 'When I left Lane that day I had no clue it would be the last time I'd see him,' she wrote. But in the early hours of the next day, she awoke to a call that Smith had been rushed to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City after he had fallen and hit his head. She and her mother raced to his side. They never considered his injuries could be life-threatening, but once they got there, they were given 'absolutely no hope that Lane was going to make it'. 'July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life,' she explained. 'I lost my best friend. The father of my unborn child. And since that day I have felt so empty inside. A part of me will forever be missing. I loved that man more than life itself.' Strong: Sharry said that part of her has been missing since the death of Taos' father but that the photograph allowed her to see her complete family for the first time. She is pictured in another image from the shoot . Missed: She said she knows that Smith, pictured left, will always be watching over her and their son, right . Their son was born just a few weeks later and when he approached six months, Sharry asked Henley, who is baked in Yukon, if she'd be able to put together a family photo. 'I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it,' Sharry explained to KOCO. So Rene created the photo that has since been shared thousands of times online. 'It brought me to tears,' Sharry wrote about the photograph. 'This is how I picture us. Taos and I living our lives the best we can with Lane ALWAYS watching over our shoulder.' Rene said she was happy to be able to help. 'As soon as I met Taos, he had a smile that was so contagious, the happiest baby boy, and he instantly captured my heart,' she said on her Facebook page. '[I] never knew if I could make this reality for them. So glad I could and they can cherish this forever.'","Lane Smith died after falling and hitting his head in July 2014 - just a few weeks before his girlfriend, Sierra Sharry, gave birth to their son, Taos .

d3db92aad34f58bf708a3845c0b2a8cfb86f2fb9,"A doctor has told the inquest into the death of a young boy who apparently died from injuries sustained while paddle boarding, that the child had been 'caned or whipped' before he died. Two-year-old Darcy Atkinson was covered in bruises and had traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system when he died on December 7, 2012. The toddler had been in the care of his mother's boyfriend Adam Taylor when he was rushed to Gosford Hospital by paramedics, before being airlifted to Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital after throwing up three times and going rigid in the bath. At the second day of a coronial inquest into the toddler's death, Intensive Care Unit clinical consultant Dr Barry Wilkins said it was not possible the head injuries the Darcy suffered came from a paddle board, as the boy's mother Tara Rae-Maxwell had previously claimed. Darcy Atkinson, two, died of brain injuries in December 2012. He was covered in bruises and had traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system when he died . Dr Wilkins described the injuries the toddler sustained as 'tram-line marks', and said he had only ever seen them inflicted on a child, News Corp reported. Darcy was covered in the lines, usually sustained from being caned or whipped, and had bad bruising around his ears which appeared to be infected, Dr Wilkins said. 'There is no doubt in my mind ... that Darcy had been assaulted physically at some stage in the day before he presented,' he told the court. 'In my opinion this child has been caned or whipped,' Dr Wilkins said, adding he had seen similar marks on a child in a landmark case where the toddler was beaten to death, about 20 years ago. The clinical consultant also noted that he notified the hospital's child protection unit soon after Darcy presented. Darcy's father, who was living in Victoria at the time of his son's death, broke down in the dock as his son's horrific injuries were described, according to News Corp. Earlier in the inquest it was revealed that the toddler was covered in bruises by the time he got to hospital, and traces of the stimulant Ritalin were found in his system. The toddler  was rushed to Gosford Hospital by paramedics before being airlifted to Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital (pictured) after throwing up three times and going rigid in the bath under his mother's boyfriend Adam Taylor's care . 'We need to call an ambulance because this isn't normal,' Mr Taylor was urged by his flatmate, Nicole Warne, Glebe Coroners Court was told on Monday. The boy, described by his father Peter Atkinson as smart and proud, had earlier been paddle boarding with Mr Taylor, the inquest was told. This is despite his mother Tara Rae-Maxwell claiming her son was 'petrified' of water, News Corp reports. He'd experienced difficulty returning to daycare after a week-long holiday and was instead put in Mr Taylor's care after telling his mother Tara Rae-Maxwell he didn't want to go to school. While on the board, Darcy had fallen back and bumped his head, Mr Taylor is alleged to have written in a text to Ms Rae-Maxwell. Mr Taylor then took Darcy to the home he shared with housemate Ms Warne for a swim. Darcy seemed fine, Ms Warne told the inquest, but he twice vomited while near the pool. Both adults became concerned when he again threw up, this time an alarming chunky-white mixture. They took Darcy to a bathroom and ran a bath to warm the boy but his body became stiff. 'That's when Adam started to panic,' Ms Warne said. The Glebe Coroners Court (pictured) heard that the usually bright and assertive young boy had become lethargic and lost patches of hair in the days before his death . Darcy, she said, was making loud, deep, gargling sounds but couldn't speak. The usually bright and assertive young boy had become lethargic and lost patches of hair in the days before his death, the court heard. When he died he had bruising on his ears, temple and limbs and traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system. After informing Ms Rae-Maxwell Darcy had bumped his head, Mr Taylor allegedly sent her a photo of the boy. 'Adam sent me pictures all the time of Darcy when he had him,' Ms Rae-Maxwell said. But she repeatedly denied receiving the photo that day and it has never been located by investigators. Deputy State Coroner Hugh Dillon questioned how a mother who posted so many Facebook photos of her son couldn't locate the image. 'I know it sounds ridiculous. I've been through so many phones,' she said. The inquest continues.

d229c2045f03cdb2054bdcf5e17e5ccc98820f2a,"An Army major and his wife engaged in 'a regimen of abuse and neglect' with their three young foster children over a period of years that left the toddlers with broken bones and numerous other health problems, a federal prosecutor told a jury at the couple's child abuse trial Monday. John and Carolyn Jackson also forced some of the children to drink hot sauce or eat hot pepper flakes and weren't exposed until one of their biological children reported the abuse to someone outside the family, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Shumofsky said in his opening statement. That child, now in his teens, is expected to provide key testimony for the prosecution. The trial marks the second go-round for the Jacksons, whose previous trial last fall ended in a mistrial when a prosecutor inadvertently referred to the fact that one of the children had died. Cruel: Army Major John Jackson (left) and his wife Carolyn (right) are currently on trial for abusing their three foster children. Pictured above in May 2013 . The judge had previously ruled that the boy's death could not be introduced during the trial since the defendants were not charged directly with his death. Second trial: The Jacksons first child abuse trial was ruled a mistrial when a prosecutor mentioned the death of one of their sons - a detail that was not supposed to be mentioned in the proceedings. The Jacksons had three biological children and three adopted children. They have only been charged for abusing the foster children . The Jacksons, who live in Mount Holly, were stationed at Picatinny Arsenal, a military installation about 40 miles west of New York City, when the abuse occurred between 2005 and 2010, according to a 15-count superseding indictment. They had three biological children who showed no signs of abuse, Shumofsky said. But they disciplined their three foster children by withholding food and water as punishment and by hitting them with different objects, he added. The treatment left them with bruises and injuries including, for one child, a skull fracture and spinal fracture, and for another, a broken arm. The children were well under normal weight when they were removed from the Jackson home, Shumofsky said, including one who weighed less at nearly three years old than he did when he joined the family at 11 months old. One of the girls had scars, marks and infections and had a dangerously high level of salt in her body that doctors said they'd never seen before in a two-year-old, Shumofsky told jurors. Attorneys representing the Jacksons conceded that though the Jacksons' child-rearing methods may be objectionable to some, they didn't rise to the level of criminality. 'You might think, `I would never raise a hand to my child,'' said attorney Rubin Sinins, representing Carolyn Jackson. 'But that doesn't make it criminal. Because what Carolyn Jackson was doing was acting in good faith in her role as parent.' Jackson would have had to have known that her actions would cause harm to be considered guilty, he added. 'If you're a crappy parent, you're not a criminal,' he said. Countering photos shown by Shumofsky that showed the children with visible marks and scars, Sinins showed jurors pictures of the two girls smiling with their parents or friends in pictures taken weeks earlier. Sinins and David Holman, representing John Jackson, both mentioned in their opening statements that while the government's experts concluded abuse had taken place though they hadn't treated the children, the children's treating doctors did not reach that conclusion.","Army Major John Jackson and his wife Carolyn are facing 15 counts of child abuse .
